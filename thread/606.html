Select all the cells except for the headers then sort by column E<br/><br/>You will now see the occupations sorted according to mean taxable income, with Surgeons first and Anaesthetists second.<br/><br/>I would be interested to hear all your thoughts.

Nonetheless, given the high employment rate for medical staff, it seems as though you've gone into the right profession.<br/><br/>It might also help make the 80K message more palatable to say rather than 'be a banker instead of a doctor', 'maybe be a doctor after all - but not for the reasons you think'.<br/><br/>It also doesn't look at income per hour, which might be very relevant a) to avoid burnout, and b) if you'd otherwise be spending your time on utilitarian causes. From what I've been told anecdotally, psychiatry is very good (compared to the rest of the medical profession) on that score.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Education has three main costs: tuition and fees, forgone earnings, and delayed earnings (discount rate/social rate of return/"haste consideration"). Together, these could easily make up the difference between financial dealers' salaries those of doctors. On the other hand, medical careers seem more accessible than high-paid banking careers—you don't have to have gone to a top school, and there is probably less competition. You do have to be pretty disciplined to do well in school for that long, though.<br/><br/>By the way, those figures presumably include bonuses (a big part of bankers' income) since the column is labeled "Taxable Income."</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">I agree that it would probably include bonuses, Pat. And good point about the years spent educating, Arepo. Having said that, bankers do tend to need to spend 3-4 years doing their undergraduate degree and then only begin on an intern salary (~$100,000), like doctors (~$50,000), and in the case of finance people, reaching a high career income depends on their career progressing over 5 or more years. At each step of the way, there is a chance of being forced to leave the job because of poor performance. On my estimates:<br/><br/>years to reach &gt;200k income in Finance: ~ 5<br/>years to reach &gt;200k income in Medicine: 13-16 years<br/>chance of failing to &gt;200k income in Finance: ~50%<br/>chance of failing to &gt;200k income in Medicine: 10%, given you have entered medical school.<br/><br/>So it is an interesting point that maybe it is better to be a doctor after all. Especially since a medical education would presumable nurture a greater degree of compassion in you (worth at least a doubling of income) be less threatened by future regulation (specific laws have been passed to reduce CEOs incomes, bankers are widely despised), be more open to the alternative possibility of research (transhumanism, neuroethics, bioethics, study of consciousness)  and education...<br/><br/>The main problem with this income survey is that it doesn't specify what better than average finance professionals and doctors earn. I am pretty sure the variance of finance earnings is much greater than the variance of medical earnings. Supposing that one embarked upon the process of career choice knowing you would be better than 90% of the competition in either discipline, then this would be a much harder choice to make. Probably then the finance income would double or triple that of the doctor. Hmm...</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote><div><cite>RyanCarey wrote:</cite>So it is an interesting point that maybe it is better to be a doctor after all. </div></blockquote><br/><br/>I think there’s a very strong case for this. Employment rates for medical graduates at the top universities are close to 100%, and as you say that probably dips <span style="font-style: italic">slower</span> than in other subjects. Employment rates for graduates from subjects relating to finance are much more varied – from memory, economics, maths and and business were mid-80s or lower in the top UK universities.<br/><br/>The potential non-financial benefits of being a doctor aren’t negligible either. Aside from any benefit gained from displacement, you might be able to offer services to people in the EA community beyond those available on their national health scheme, which could potentially make a big difference to them.<br/><br/>As for ‘knowing you’d be better than 90% of the competition in any discipline’ – that’s possibly true, but given the Lake Wobegon effect, something like 50% of potential doctors/financiers would ‘know’ that, so if they all acted on that knowledge, their total net income, judging by the ATO survey, could end up being significantly lower than it would have been had they all just gone into medicine.<br/><br/>That said I don’t agree greater compassion is obviously worth halving incomes – after all, a moderately selfish person and a moderately less selfish person might have a similar income before they hit huge diminishing returns on income:personal happiness, so if hypothetical person A’s salary were twice as high as B’s, B’s comfort threshold would need to be half A’s before he had any chance at all of doing better, and the higher the income, the less relevant that threshold would be. But I don’t think that really applies here. <br/><br/>Presumably there <span style="font-style: italic">are</span> some options (management?) available for doctors to significantly increase their income above the mean, even if they’re rarer than in banking. And the increased salary from such options will probably draw less competition than it would in a field like banking, since it’s not the reason for many doctors to have gone into their field in the first place.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

In general, though, I think it's good to avoid paying too much attention to news-type stories like these; the nationwide figures are less likely to be statistical fluctuations.

I think that Arepo and yourself should adopt a couple of  justifiable assumptions, and then you will come around to my position.<br/>1. We are mostly interest in what recommendations to make publicly. Let's take as our example case someone who has taken up membership with 80k hours, but they are not part of the core administration, they are more of a fringe member.<br/>2. On average, this person might donate 2% of their lifetime's income. They could donate 50% (a 25x inrease)<br/><br/>Also consider that a good doctor can save perhaps five more lives than an average doctor per year, five lives per year for a 40 year career would make 200 lives. Current GWWC presentations suggest that giving 10% would save about 500 lives, then this is a significant factor for a better than average doctor.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
