<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">I think there is tons of uncertainty in utilitarianism, so I wanted to document some of the questions here.  Feel free to add more questions or answers, and I'll try to keep this OP updated semi-systematically.  Perhaps the utilitarian thing to do would be to spend some time bringing about answers to these questions?<br/><br/>The goal of this thread is not to start a discussion of every single problem of utilitarianism all in one (cramped) place, but to direct people to work on answering these questions, or create a repository for future research.  Ideal conversations here would be meta-level (talking about the list, updating the list, telling me this is a dumb idea) or directing people to existing resources or conversations on each question in <span style="font-weight: bold">other threads</span>.<br/><br/>Note that a blank answer to a question doesn't mean that there is no answer, or even that I don't have an answer, though it definitely <span style="font-style: italic">could</span>.  And I probably forgot something, or many things.<br/><br/>This was last updated by me on <span style="font-weight: bold">July 14, 2012</span>.<br/><br/>~<br/><br/><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Problems in Meta-Ethics</span></span><br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">Meta-ethics deals with questions like what the words "ought", "right", "good", etc. refer to and what morality is.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">1.) Is there a meta-ethical reason to privelege utilitarianism over other moral systems?  If so, what would it be?  If not, is there a meta-ethical reason to dismiss utilitarianism completely?</span><br/><br/>I think this question <a class="postlink" href="../thread/612.html#p5876">has been resolved</a> with good confidence that utilitarianism is just one moral system among many that can be used to judge action as morally right or wrong, and that other systems -- as long as they're internally coherent -- are no less valid from a meta-ethical standpoint.  Thus, the adoption of utilitarianism over another system would be a matter of personal preference, even if it would be the utilitarian thing to do, and utilitarian-morally wrong not to do so.<br/><br/>Also, threats from non-cognitivism and anti-realism don't seem to undermine there being a fact of the matter as to whether something meets the standards of utilitarianism, so that would make utilitarianism an open option, and thus no reason to dismiss it either.<br/><br/>~<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">2.) If the adoption of utilitarianism is a matter of personal preference, why might someone want to adopt it?</span><br/><br/>The only reason I can think of is that some people just have utilitarian values as <a class="postlink" href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/l4/terminal_values_and_instrumental_values/">terminal values</a>.<br/><br/>~<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">3.) If utilitarianism is largely a choice, how do we as utilitarians get along with those of other meta-ethical persuasions?</span><br/><br/>~<br/><br/><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Problems in Normative Ethics</span></span><br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">Normative ethics deals with how a given moral framework is actually implemented to measure action; how you figure out what is morally right given a stipulated definition.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">5.) What matters when it comes to happiness -- total happiness or average happiness?</span><br/><br/>~<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">4.) How should preferences or happiness be aggregated?</span><br/><br/>~<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">6.) What does happiness look like or consist of?  What does more happiness look like?

What are some optimal actions for improving the world?  What are some utilitarianism best practices?</span><br/><br/>Shifting toward veganism and shifting toward donating as much as your income to effective charities as possible seem to be commonsense targets right now.<br/><br/>~<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">11.) How does one keep a utilitarian motivation going?</span><br/><br/>Joining communities like <a class="postlink" href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">GivingWhatWeCan</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://80000hours.org/">80000Hours</a>, or this forum seems to help.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>5.) What matters when it comes to happiness -- total happiness or average happiness?</div></blockquote><br/>Total happiness. I like to test my intuitions about such questions with thought experiments. Here is one: You are at the end of your life. You can gain either one absolutely brilliant additional day, or 10 trillion worthwhile but only moderately good additional days (assuming no externalities in either case). Here, I would choose the 10 trillion, irregardless of the utility distribution in the rest of the universe.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>8.) What do we make of the Utility Monster?</div></blockquote><br/>We recognize that it is an unrealistic concept, but conceptually bite the bullet. Thought experiment: An immortal person is caught in a magic trap that will torture him for 10 septillion years. For every second of pain we accept instead, we can shorten the duration of his pain by 1 year. The right thing to do, imo, would be to absorb all his pain. Conversely, if he could gain 1 year of pleasure for each second of pleasure we forgo, the right thing to do would be to forgo all our pleasure.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>9.) What do we make of the Repugnant Conclusion?</div></blockquote><br/>We acknowledge that mere existence is not the same thing as utility, and that lives even barely worth living require a recognizable amount of good conditions. We acknowledge that <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wisebrain.org/papers/NegSalienceinMem.pdf">bad is stronger than good</a> and that the repugnant conclusion only applies if the quantity of additional net-positive life actually outweighs the quality reduction in the lesser populated scenarios. We then conclude that <span style="font-style: italic">taking these conditions seriously</span>, a scenario in which they are met is not in any way repugnant, but actually desirable.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>13.) What can be done about wild animal suffering?</div></blockquote><br/>Some relevant links by <a class="postlink" href="http://robertwiblin.com/2010/01/21/just-destroy-nature/">Robert Wiblin</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://robertwiblin.com/2012/05/20/what-is-to-be-done-about-animals/">Robert Wiblin again</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://hedweb.com/abolitionist-project/reprogramming-predators.html">David Pearce</a>.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote><div><cite>RyanCarey wrote:</cite>I've argued that we should embrace the repugnant conclusion, and the reasons we think that this conclusion is repugnant are:<br/>1.

The repugnant conclusion only seems weird because fundamentally humans don't understand numbers bigger than about four, and so we have no conceptual idea of what it meas to send the number of humans living marginally positive lives to infinity.  Intuitively we just think of infinity as a big number, kind of like 100,000, or 18.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The problem I'm keenest to address is:<br/>1.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>2.) If the adoption of utilitarianism is a matter of personal preference, why might someone want to adopt it?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Utilitarianism is practical, it also seems to be the only ethical system I know of that isn't short-sighted/based in wishful thinking.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>3.) If utilitarianism is largely a choice, how do we as utilitarians get along with those of other meta-ethical persuasions?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>We try to separate people that are hurt by people of other meta-ethical persuasions against their will and ignore the rest. If no one is suffering we don't need to concern ourselves with it. <br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>5.) What matters when it comes to happiness -- total happiness or average happiness?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I think the priority should be to reduce pain. So in that sense its neither. I think securing a minimal happiness for an arbitrary percent of the population should be met first. Happy people don't really need to be happier. I don't like turning this into a math or number game because that doesn't make sense to me, but as a metaphor its like, bringing a person from 1 happiness to 2, is more important than a person from 100 to 110 because the first person had 100% increase in happiness and the second only 10%. It's also more important bringing some one from -1 to 1 than some one from 1 to 10.<br/><br/>I'd need a more real example to answer better.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>4.) How should preferences or happiness be aggregated?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I didn't understand this one.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>6.) What does happiness look like or consist of? What does more happiness look like? What kind of happiness does utilitarianism care about?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>What does it consist of? Literally? Chemicals in the brain. Metaphorically? Same old stuff every ones said, it depends on the person etc. I'd think utilitarianism cares about any form of happiness that doesn't create more problems.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>7.) How is happiness measured?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Several different ways. Just ask people "How happy are you on a scale from 1 to 10." or look at suicide rates etc.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>8.) What do we make of the Utility Monster?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I answered this for #5 and addressed it somewhat in the other thread I posted. Again you'd need to give me a more specific situation to answer better.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>9.) What do we make of the Repugnant Conclusion?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Again, my answer for #5 addresses this a bit. Not just that but I also think that utilitarians have a duty to preserve the capability for future generation to be happy. As I said in my other post I think its a given humanity will die out as some point (10 years, 100 years, 1,000 years, 1,000,000,000,000,000 years, you get the point, I don't know when). But for the sake of argument lets assume its forever, 100,000,000 people living at a time for <span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">âˆž</span></span> years creates the same happiness as 10,000,000,000 at a time for <span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">âˆž</span></span> years.<br/><br/>I didn't know what the Repugnant Conclusion was till you posed this so I read <a class="postlink" href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/repugnant-conclusion/">this.</a><br/><br/>It says:<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Is there a moral obligation to have children?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Is it suggesting we are a moral obligation to have children because we are utilitarians to increase the number of people to be happy? <br/><br/>If any thing its the opposite. We have a moral obligation to not overpopulate the planet so that others can be happier. If humanity wasn't approaching the double digit billions maybe, but the way things are now no.<br/><br/>I've made the personal choice that I will not have children of my own, instead I will adopt. I think that overpopulation is the biggest thing preventing happiness and causing pain, it should be one of the biggest issues to utilitarians.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>10.) What are some optimal actions for improving the world? What are some utilitarianism best practices?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>As I just said, I think working against overpopulation is very important.<br/>Also:<br/>- Starvation<br/>- Unnecessary or selfish Wars<br/>- Disease<br/><br/>It seems like a stupid list being its kinda common sense to prevent those things.<br/><br/>As for action against them donation, volunteering, talking about it. All good. As for if utilitarians should not have kids, that's a very tricky subject that would need its own thread. On the one hand overpopulation is a massive problem, on the other if utilitarians stop having kids there will be less genetic material attracted to utilitarianism, and with less utilitarians there in theory will be less good in the world. <br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>11.) How does one keep a utilitarian motivation going?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I remember there are people with much worse lives. Just a general sense of empathy.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>12.) What can be done about existential risk? Is reducing existential risk even desirable?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Don't be stupid, reckless or selfish/greedy. Against from my other thread. The continuation of a sentient utilitarian species is only trumped by the continuation of life. <br/><br/>Two things here.<br/><br/>1) I'm assuming you are asking this to know if the survival of humanity warrants how we treat other animals. If we can determine our pleasure is greater, than its justified (nothing new, but a hard thing to do and too open to bias).<br/>2) What's the likely-hood enough of humanity will be utilitarians (or other philosophies) to prevent unhappiness?<br/><br/>I'd say yes. It's desirable.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>13.) What can be done about wild animal suffering?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>What can be done, or what should be done? If you prevent a rabbit from being eaten by a fox you save the rabbit from suffering but cause the fox to suffer. I think humanity needs to get its own shit together first. <br/><br/>I'll reply to Problems in Meta-Applied Ethics tomorrow, its late. I didn't even proof-read (sorry) I'll do that tomorrow too.<br/><br/>Goodnight all.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

There would be one driving force for this natural selection and that is that utilitarians don't have kids. Without any or at least very little overlap into other traits, by that I mean the only thing determining if some one had kids or not is if they are utilitarian, I think this is much too strong of a mechanistic to be ignored for long. <br/><br/>We can buy ourselves some time though, because the larger a population is with frequent gene trading the harder it is for natural selection to affect the population, thus this evolution away from utilitarianism would take longer.<br/><br/>We have a population of over 7 billion and there are no natural borders we can't frequently cross to isolate groups of population. This means any natural selection affecting us would take considerable time to kick-in. <br/><br/>It's like adding yellow pain to blue paint. If there is a  drop of yellow added at a time to a drop of blue, it turns to green after just 1 drop, and to green yellow after just 2. But if you are adding 1 drop of yellow paint to 7 billion drops of blue it might take a while.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

When you sell sperm, it lowers the market price of sperm, making it so more people will buy and fewer will sell. The total increase in children born will be PED/(PED-PES) times the number of children you sell enough sperm to make, where PED is price elasticity of demand, and PES is price elasticity of supply. Note that PED is normally negative, so it's |PED|/(|PED|+PES). This is similar to the effect eating meat has on the amount of animals killed, which comes out to -PES/(PED-PES) times the amount you refrain from eating, or PES/(|PED|+PES).<br/><br/>I have no idea what values PES or PED have in this case, so I can't really tell you much beyond that it comes out to somewhere between zero and one.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote><div><cite>Nap wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Hedonic Treader wrote:</cite>Utilitarianism reproduces memetically, not genetically. There is no utilitarianism gene. If there are personality traits that correlate with acceptance of utilitarianism, and genes that correlate with those personality traits, the total correlation between genes and acceptance of utilitarianism may exist, but be very weak. You can of course pass on memes to your biological or adopted children's brains, but you cannot control that they stay dominant there once they become powerful adults. You would do more good to hand an attractive utilitarianism pamphlet out to many existing adolescents.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>If all utilitarians stopped having kids I think over time the likely-hood of more utilitarians emerging would have to go down. There would be one driving force for this natural selection and that is that utilitarians don't have kids. Without any or at least very little overlap into other traits, by that I mean the only thing determining if some one had kids or not is if they are utilitarian, I think this is much too strong of a mechanistic to be ignored for long. <br/><br/>We can buy ourselves some time though, because the larger a population is with frequent gene trading the harder it is for natural selection to affect the population, thus this evolution away from utilitarianism would take longer.<br/><br/>We have a population of over 7 billion and there are no natural borders we can't frequently cross to isolate groups of population. This means any natural selection affecting us would take considerable time to kick-in. <br/><br/>It's like adding yellow pain to blue paint. If there is a  drop of yellow added at a time to a drop of blue, it turns to green after just 1 drop, and to green yellow after just 2. But if you are adding 1 drop of yellow paint to 7 billion drops of blue it might take a while.</div></blockquote><br/><br/><br/>The thing is that raising kids takes time, and if your goal is to grow the number of utilitarians it might be (and probably would be) more efficient to spend  the time convincing people to become utilitarians than changing a baby's diaper.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">I posted my reply to Hutch and DanielLC in my other thread. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/> <a class="postlink" href="../thread/661.html">Here</a>.<br/><br/>This is my reply to Problems in Meta-Applied Ethics.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>15.) Which currently existing life is sentient enough to suffer in ways relevant to a utilitarian?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I think this question needs to be put into the context of our technological evolution. If we were living in the wild and we hunted to survive I'd think this would excuse our eating habits more than they do now.<br/><br/>If we had artificial or grown from plants meat (that was just like "the real deal"), there wouldn't be a good excuse at all left to eat real meat (not one I can think of at least). <br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>16.) Do nonhuman animals living in the wild live net-negative lives?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>"in the wild", "unnatural/natural" in common use these words might be fine, but in a philosophical setting they don't work well. What is unnatural? Nothing can be unnatural because every thing is part of nature. Would you call a beaver damn unnatural? <br/><br/>If you like to think like Peter Singer than you are thinking about interests, and animals in the wild do have interest and on occasion they are met. <br/><br/>I think its overall best to try and separate any damage we do to their interests and let natural selection run its course (I don't mean we have to stop interacting with all animals in the "wild" I'm just saying we should try to not spill oil everywhere for example and not concern our selves with things that are not our fault, for now at least). If a species starts to show signs of higher sentience than maybe.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>17.) Would a future with humans be better than a future without humans?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Nah. This is wandering into the realm of B.S. in my opinion but if this helps you here is a quick (quick, maybe or maybe not good) solution.<br/><br/>Again thinking in terms of interests, its every living organisms interest to spread and last over time. Humanity is biological based earthling (earthling in this context meaning all life on earth not just human) life's best hope for both. We are life's best bet to spread to other planets (or even solar systems). This is in the interest of all life and so we are the best thing life could ask for right now.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>18.) What should we make of Pascalian arguments of a shot at really high utility at a really low probability, especially when the precise level of utility or probability is unknown?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I try to have the view that we should only shoot for certain improvements. High-risk high-reward situations are not appealing to me. <br/><br/>If you are constantly gambling, a greater happiness is uncertain. If you can ensure a constant uptrend happiness is certain. This is due to my longsighted approach to most problems. I like to think about adverse long term affects a decision might have.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">I for one am pretty happy to accept the Sam is Great Conclusion.<br/><br/>I'm surprised though that when discussing the RC and UM alongside, you donâ€™t point out how closely related they are â€“ each is conceptually a reductio of rejection of the other. Think having loads of just-barely-happy people sounds horrible? Then you must support condensing them into fewer more-happy-people. One entity getting all the utility is unjust? Then you presumably prefer it if we divide it into numerous proportionately-less-happy entities.<br/><br/>It seems you might be able to win people over with a different reductio then â€“ if you donâ€™t like the RP because it spreads happiness too thinly and you donâ€™t like the UM because it concentrates it so much, you must think thereâ€™s some sort of Goldilocks proportion, where we have just the right amount of entities with just the right amount of happiness.<br/><br/>Iâ€™m too tired to try and fill in the dots, but you could presumably them commit people who claimed that to some fairly odd conclusions eg about adding two more happy people to the crowd being better but less than twice as good as adding one, or even worse than adding none at all.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
