<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">I have a few comments on the proposed study and some examples of existing research that shows something similar, but first.... <br/><br/>This forum would be more focussed on a discussion of why it is that you (and others) believe that consumerism is a crime against nature. I am familiar with models of ecologically responsible behavior, so I tend to describe such issues from a psychological viewpoint, but the challenge of <span style="font-style: italic">changing</span> such behavior through the philosophy of this forum would probably include a demonstration of the many ways that the natural environment benefits humans or perhaps how nature has intrinsic value that is important to humans.<br/><br/>As for why people fail to see the value in nature, I could suggest many things, one of which is the preoccupation with consumerism and other worldly pursuits that stem, in part, from a failure to understand the invalidity of social value placed on socio-economic status. In other words, from the philosophy of utilitarianism, I would say that people cannot simply start weighing utility of nature because they begin the analysis with faulty ideas that they adopted from their cultural surrounding without the scrutiny of reason.<br/><br/>As for the study you described, my first comment is that in many places you mention "emotion" when the study itself addresses only "empathy." People can have many emotions while absorbed in the consumerist delusion: envy, fear, jealousy, anger.... Unfortunately, envy, fear (of somebody discovering that you really aren’t cool), jealousy, and the like do not produce behaviors that are good for humans in the long run. Empathy is useful because it can lead to prosocial behavior and ecologically responsible behavior.<br/><br/>Another way to explore the proposed study is to first review the mountains of research that shows that perspective-taking increases empathy, which increases altruisitic behavior, then show that people in certain modes of existence fail to take the time to consider other people (or animals or nature). Here is one study that might be related to your topic. The general idea is that when people misunderstand the origins of their emotions, they respond differently to those emotions. Coke, Batson, and McDavis (1978) played a recording of a radio program about a girl whose parents died in a car crash. Some were then asked to imagine how the girl felt and some reviewed broadcasting techniques (as a control treatment). Before the study, participants were given a pill, half were told that it would relax them and half were told that it would arouse them. The results showed that those in the relaxation condition gave much more money than those in the arousal condition, and those who imagined the girls situation have the most (Coke et al., 1978, p. 756). In other words, when people mistakenly thought that their emotional experience was caused by the pill and not their feelings of empathy, they did not respond in the appropriate manner. The link to your study might be that people who live hectic lives are under stress (or other emotional influences) fail to properly identify emotions that are really caused from empathy or something like it. Their second study was similar but used electrodes and false feedback to tell (randomly) some people that they had a strong emotional response to the story about people dying in the car crash. Those who were (randomly) told that they had a strong emotional impact gave more money to help (because of they way they interpreted their alleged emotional reaction).<br/><br/>There was another study that I can’t find right now, but the general idea was this. Students were given a task to take something across campus. Some were told that they had to get to the other building as fast as possible and others were given plenty of time. Those who were under time pressure were much less likely to help a stranger. I think this study was from the 1970s or 1980s, perhaps by Cialdini, Batson, Shalom Schwartz, or Dovidio, and it might have focussed on the effects of egoistic concern or stress on altruistic behavior or helping behavior (if you find it, let me know). The point is that people under stress don't consider things outside themselves (or at least act as if they don't).<br/><br/>Reference<br/><br/>Coke, J. S., Batson, C. D., &amp; McDavis, K. (1978).

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Food, Clothing &amp; Shelter......these are the maximum number of things this planet can provide to humans....... Industrial consumer goods must be eliminated immediately.<br/><br/>Industrial Society is doing research on sustainability after destroying 75 - 90% of Biodiversity and Ecosystems. Nature has already done millions of years of research on sustainability.......Nature has already given us millions of years of proof of sustainability. Animals did not destroy Environment for millions of years because their activity was limited to searching for food. Hunter Gatherer Society did not destroy Environment for a million years because their activity was limited to searching for food. Agrarian Society caused very limited destruction of environment over 10,000 years [compared to Industrial Society]because their activity was limited to food, clothing and shelter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>For the last 50 years Intellectuals have been debating what is good for Environment......Capitalist Industrial Society, Communist Industrial Society or Socialist Industrial Society?<br/><br/>This is like debating what is good for people.....Capitalist Poison, Communist Poison or Socialist Poison.<br/><br/>Poison kills people.....it does'nt matter who made it ......Capitalism, Communism or Socialism.<br/><br/>Industrial Activity kills ecosystems.....It does'nt matter which system runs it.....Capitalism, Communism or Socialism.<br/><br/>All Industrial Activity destroys environment......Mining Industry, Logging Industry, Energy Generation Industry, Manufacturing Industry, Transportation Industry, Construction Industry, Recycling Industry, Oil Drilling, Oil Refining, Millions of kilometers of Rail &amp; Road network and Shipping Lanes…..they all destroy environment….. It does'nt matter which system runs it.....Capitalism, Communism or Socialism.<br/><br/>American Industrial Activity has destroyed ecosystems…..Russian Industrial Activity has destroyed ecosystems……Chinese Industrial Activity has destroyed ecosystems…….Indian Industrial Activity has destroyed ecosystems……Every Industrial Society destroys ecosystems…… It does'nt matter which system runs it.....Capitalism, Communism or Socialism.<br/><br/>In just 250 years Industrial Society has destroyed 75 - 90% of Forests, Wild Animals and Fish Population......Population of Lions, Tigers and Elephants is down to 2 - 5% of what it was 100 years ago......Population of Large Fish in Oceans is down to 10% of what it was 100 years ago.....Industrial Society has poisoned the entire planet with Trillions of Tonnes of Metal Waste, Plastic Waste, Chemical Waste, Gaseous Waste, eWaste, Nuclear Waste.....It has killed Trillions of Animals in Industrial Slaughter Houses and billions of acres of Fertile Soil with Cement And Concrete.<br/><br/>Animals did not destroy Environment for millions of years.......because their activity was limited to searching for food.<br/><br/>Hunter Gatherer Society did not destroy Environment for a million years.......because their activity was limited to searching for food.<br/><br/>Agrarian Society caused very limited destruction of environment over 10,000 years[compared to Industrial Society].......because their activity was limited to food, clothing and shelter.<br/><br/>Industrial Society has destroyed almost all Ecosystems in just 250 years......because it is destroying environment for thousands of consumer goods and services in addition to food, clothing and shelter.<br/><br/>Industrial Activity for production of Consumer Goods must stop immediately.......Human work must be limited to Food, Clothing and Shelter......And even in these three fields production and consumption must be kept to the minimum.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There is only one cause of environmental destruction......Industrialization.<br/><br/>Overpopulation and Overconsumerism are only consequences/ by-products of Industrialization.<br/><br/>Overconsumerism is quite obviously a consequence of Industrialization..... Industrial consumer goods and services would not exist without Industrial Activity.<br/><br/>Overpopulation is also a by-product of Industrialization. The entire world was overbreeding until the middle years of 20th century.....even Western Countries had 5 - 12 children per family[and even more].....and yet population of the world remained low before industrialization because of high death rate, lower life span and shortage of food and water. It was only 1 billion in 1800 AD. India and China have large populations today because they started with larger populations thousands of years ago, since ancient civilizations thrived in these regions. What was the population of Europe/ America/ West 2000 years ago????......Was it comparable to eastern population of India and China????<br/><br/>Industrialization is the cause of overpopulation and overconsumerism.<br/><br/>Moreover, Environment has been destroyed by Industrialization/ Consumerism…….Not by Population/ Overpopulation.<br/><br/>Total World Population has not increased ……It has decreased……In fact total world population has been decimated.<br/><br/>When we talk of population we should take into account population of all animal species, not just human population.<br/><br/>Industrial Society has decimated millions of Animal Species……Increase in human population has coincided with decrease/ decimation of millions of animal species. The total burden of population on this planet has not increased…..It has decreased.<br/><br/>Industrial Society has decimated millions of other species.....but there was a time when the combined population of other animal species was much greater than present human population.....and we don't even need to include smaller animals in this count.....the combined population of big animals alone whose size and weight was equivalent to or greater than man was much greater than current human population of 7 billion.<br/><br/>The amount of food this animal population was eating was much greater than the food consumed by humans today.......Yet millions of animal species did not destroy environment and lived sustainably on earth for millions of years......because they destroyed environment only for food and not for thousands of consumer goods and services.<br/><br/>If animals had started a consumerist "Industrial Society" millions of years ago they would have destroyed all ecosystems millions of years ago.<br/><br/>The entire world has been trying to control human population for 50 years and these efforts should / will continue in future.....so where is the problem with population?????<br/><br/>What is the cause of human overpopulation??????......It is Industrialization......World population increased from 1 billion in 1800 to 7 billion today ........In the absence of Industrialization world population would only be a small fraction of 7 billion today.<br/><br/>It is not population that destroys environment......It is lifestyle.......The combined population of millions of animal species was much greater than present human population.......and yet they did not destroy environment for millions of years because they destroyed environment only for Food.......not for Thousands of Consumer Goods.<br/><br/>The cause of Environmental Destruction is Industrialization / Consumerism.........Not population / overpopulation.<br/><br/>A Hunter_Gatherer Society of 7 billion would not destroy environment [And a Hunter_Gatherer Society would never reach a population of 7 billion]<br/><br/>An Agrarian Society of 7 billion would cause much lesser environmental destruction than an Industrial Society of 7 billion [And an Agrarian Society would never reach a population of 7 billion]<br/><br/>Industrialization is the cause of Human Overpopulation and Overconsumerism<br/><br/>It is so ridiculous of Industrial Society to complain about overpopulation when it itself is the cause of overpopulation......It is so ridiculous of Industrial Society to make attempts to control population while promoting Consumerism, Growth Rate, Economy Rate and GDP exponentially.<br/><br/>Height of Insanity!<br/><br/>Industrial Activity for production of Consumer Goods must stop immediately.......Human work must be limited to Food, Clothing and Shelter.<br/><br/><br/>sushil_yadav<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Industrial Society Destroys Mind and Environment </span></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">There's more to how much we can support than the amount of natural resources. Infrastructure and technological advance are necessary too. If we do a certain amount of damage to the environment, the opportunity cost is the same as if we fail to build a certain amount of infrastructure, or fail to do a certain amount of scientific research. As such, it is commonly worth while to destroy a certain amount of the environment to help us in other ways.<br/><br/>Consumerism helps none of these, and it would be much better in the long run if we could cut down on it as a society. That being said, we should only worry about saving the environment insomuch as its value will increase fast enough to make up for the the high future value of current investments. If cutting our power consumption in half now will double our economic output in a hundred years due to the greenhouse effect, it's not worth it. If it will multiply it by a factor of 10 in a thousand years, it's not even worth considering.<br/><br/>I just made those numbers up. I don't know whether we exploit the environment too much or too little. I'm just pointing out that it is possible to exploit it too little.<br/><br/>Also, none of this takes into account the intrinsic value of the environment. I should point out that it's not necessarily positive. There is a lot of suffering going on in the wild.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1"><blockquote><div><cite>sushil_yadav wrote:</cite>Human work must be limited to Food, Clothing and Shelter.</div></blockquote><br/>I have three responses to this. The first one is the obvious and somewhat cheap point that you're being inconsistent by typing this message into a globally connected computer terminal. The second is that I have no intention of living with my consumption reduced to food, clothing and shelter. I'd rather not exist.<br/><br/>The most important point is that I don't share the almost religious belief that nature has intrinsic value. In my mind, consciousness-supporting nature is an evolved accident, a pathological state to be overcome by intelligence - either by transformation or destruction.<br/><br/>Compare Earth 50 million years ago, before civilization existed, with Venus. I submit to you that Venus was in a better state precisely because no large-scale involuntary suffering existed on it. I submit to you that Venus still is in a better state than Earth today, for the same reason.<br/><br/>If you care to familiarize yourself with the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.hedweb.com/abolitionist-project/index.html">Abolitionist Project</a>, you will realize that the end of suffering - through other means than destruction - is only possible through high technology, which is intrically linked, at least indirectly, to the general customs and freedoms of a consumerist society.<br/><br/>Nature is not a loving mother. It doesn't have intrinsic value. It is a non-intentional purposeless system that causes  fun and pleasure, but also extreme harm and agony to uncounted billions of non-consenting sentient entities within it. If anything, we're not destroying it fast enough.<br/><br/>You are right about one thing, however: We often consume goods that promise us happiness without delivering it. That, too, is a state to overcome.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

save the victim.......They plead with the man asking him to save the victim by stopping the shooting.<br/><br/>The man says.....Don't worry......I will save him by changing technology......He replaces the old gun with a new one ........And continues to shoot.<br/><br/>.<br/>.<br/><br/>Environment has been destroyed by Industrial Activity........Trying to save environment without stopping Industrial

of poisoning by giving him even more poison.<br/><br/>Height of Insanity, Abnormality and Criminality.......You cannot save environment by destroying more of it.<br/><br/>Industrial Society has been destroying Extra environment for 250 years........It has been destroying environment for "thousands of consumer goods and services" in addition to food, clothing and shelter.<br/><br/>You cannot save a person after killing him.......You cannot save environment after it has been killed by Industrial Activity.<br/><br/>The entire Industrial Society deserves the Nobel Prize for Lunacy for pretending that environment is getting saved when the reality is that Industrial Society has been destroying extra environment after industrialization and has destroyed so much extra environment in 250 years that there is hardly any environment left to save.<br/><br/>.<br/>.<br/><br/>Discussion cannot save environment........Money cannot save environment......Technology cannot save environment......Environmental Organizations cannot save environment.......Activism cannot save environment.<br/><br/>Animal Species and Hunter_Gatherer Society did not save environment through

money.<br/><br/>Animal species, Hunter_Gatherer Society and Agrarian Society did not save environment with modern technology........They had no modern technology......It was absence of modern technology that saved environment in pre-industrial societies........Over-exploitation of ecosystems became possible only because of Industrial Machines.<br/><br/>Animal species, Hunter_Gatherer

environment for millions of years.......Hunter Gatherer Society destroyed very little environment during a million years of existence......Agrarian Society destroyed very little environment [compared to Industrial Society] over a period of 10,000 years.<br/><br/>There is only one way to save environment.......Destroy less......Minimize the list of things that are destroying environment.<br/><br/>.<br/>.<br/><br/>Promoters of Growth rate, Economy Rate and GDP are the biggest terrorists on earth.......Millions of times bigger terrorists than Taliban and Al

Urban Dwellers are the destroyers of Forests, Villages, Tribal Land, Rivers, Oceans and Atmosphere.<br/><br/>For millions of years "searching for food" / “producing food” were the primary activities of animal species, hunter_gatherer society and agrarian society.........and that is why they sustained for millions of years because they destroyed very little environment compared to Industrial Society.......For millions of years the list of things that destroyed environment never exceeded food, clothing and shelter.<br/><br/>In Industrial Society 50% of world population is growing food for 100% of population and the remaining 50% living in cities is primarily engaged in production and marketing of "thousands of consumer goods and services".<br/><br/>It is impossible to save environment as long as Urban Population exists in this world.<br/><br/>It is impossible to save environment as long as Urban Population is engaged in production and marketing of consumer goods and services.<br/><br/>It is impossible to save environment as long as Urban Population is promoting Industrial Activity.<br/><br/>Industrial Activity is directly proportional to percentage of Urban Population.<br/><br/>Consumerism is directly proportional to percentage of Urban Population.<br/><br/>Destruction of environment is directly proportional to percentage of Urban Population.<br/><br/>Most of the people who do not produce food are engaged in production and marketing of consumer goods and services.<br/><br/>Most of the urban population is engaged in production and marketing of consumer goods and services.<br/><br/>In America 90 - 95% of population is urban......In Europe 80 – 90% of population is urban......this is why consumerism is so rampant in US and West.<br/><br/>World wide the percentage of urban population is about 50%.......If the entire world is made communist or socialist it is not going to stop/ reduce consumerism as long as the percentage of urban population remains the same.<br/><br/>As long as Urban Population exists all Industrial Activities will continue to exist and expand........

Industrial Activity for production of "consumer goods" and services is the biggest destroyer of environment.<br/><br/>Millions of people are working in Sports Industry......Environment is destroyed to manufacture millions of tonnes of Sports Equipment......Millions of Trees have been cut down and billions of acres of fertile soil has been killed with Cement &amp; Concrete to build millions of Stadiums.<br/><br/>Millions of people are working in Tourism Industry......Tourism is all about Travelling which promotes Transportation Industry that destroys Environment......Millions of kilometers of Road and Rail network cutting through Forests destroying Trees and Wildlife.....Millions of kilometers of Shipping Lanes torturing and killing Fish.....Millions of kilometers of Air Routes killing the Air with millions of tonnes of exhaust gases.<br/><br/>Millions of people are working in Entertainment Industry........Environment has been destroyed to construct millions of Buildings that are used for entertainment and to produce millions of tonnes of Electronic Equipment that provides entertainment.<br/><br/>Millions of people are working for "Military Industrial Complex" producing and selling billions of tonnes of weapons all over the world......

You posted that article, but presumably you are using a computer, which is contrary to what you posted.<br/><br/>Environmental problems have been identified.  I guess the question is if you can find a way to work toward solutions.  Part of that might be to examine the assumptions and values behind your posts and determine which parts of those can be argued objectively to the people who consume and produce the most.  It is difficult to objectively identify how much personal sacrifice a person should make to avoid ecological problems, but there might be ways to influence or lead people to do what they already know that they should be doing.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

.....And once again, In the absence of Industrialization India and China would not be having large populations today.<br/><br/>If Industrialization had not happened, High death rate would have kept population of the world under control....Diseases caused by virus and bacteria would have kept population under control.....Feeding capacity of soil would have kept population under control....Shortage of food and water would have kept population under control.....Harsh Climatic Conditions would have kept population under control - People would not have been able to live in regions that are too hot or too cold.<br/><br/>If Industrialization had not happened this planet would have been in very good condition today.....There would be no overpopulation, no overconsumerism and only limited urbanization.<br/><br/>A Non-Industrial Society would have destroyed some ecosystems on the land [Forests] but Marine Ecology [Oceans] would have been almost 100% safe today......Forest Cover would be much greater than what it is now....Millions of species on the land and in the sea would not have been decimated and would be thriving with very healthy populations......This planet would be free of Billions of Tonnes of Metal Waste, Plastic Waste, Chemical waste, Gaseous Waste, eWaste and Nuclear Waste.....The Oceans wouldn't have become Acidic, Warmer and Oxygen Deprived because of Industrial Waste.<br/><br/>It is consumerism that destroys environment, Not population.<br/><br/>A Hunter_Gatherer Society of 7 billion would have destroyed very little environment...... because it would have destroyed environment only for food......not for thousands of consumer goods and services.<br/><br/>An Agrarian Society of 7 billion would have destroyed very little environment [compared to an Industrial Society of 7 billion]...... because it would have destroyed environment only for food, clothing and shelter.......not for thousands of consumer goods and services.<br/><br/>[By the way, A Hunter_Gatherer Society would have never reached a population of 7 billion......An Agrarian Society would have never reached a population of 7 billion]<br/><br/>Environment has been destroyed by Industrialization/ Consumerism…….Not by Population/ Overpopulation.<br/><br/>Total World Population has not increased ……It has decreased……In fact total world population has been decimated.<br/><br/>When we talk about population we should take into account population of all animal species on earth, not just human population.<br/><br/>Industrial Society has decimated millions of Animal Species……Increase in human population has coincided with decrease/ decimation of millions of animal species.... The total burden of population on this planet has not increased…..It has decreased.<br/><br/>Industrial Society has decimated millions of other species......There was a time when the combined population of other animal species was much greater than present human population.....and we don't even need to include smaller animals in this count.....The combined population of big animals alone whose size and weight was equivalent to or greater than man was much greater than current human population of 7 billion.<br/><br/>The amount of food this animal population was eating was much greater than the food consumed by humans today.......Yet millions of animal species did not destroy environment and lived sustainably on earth for millions of years......because they destroyed environment only for food and not for thousands of consumer goods and services.<br/><br/>If animals had started a consumerist "Industrial Society" millions of years ago they would have destroyed all ecosystems millions of years ago.<br/><br/>The entire world has been trying to control human population for 50 years and these efforts should / will continue in future.....so where is the problem with population?????<br/><br/>It is so ridiculous of Industrial Society to complain about overpopulation when it itself is the cause of overpopulation......It is so ridiculous of Industrial Society to make attempts to control population while promoting Consumerism, Growth Rate, Economy Rate and GDP exponentially.<br/><br/>This planet can only sustain a Non-Industrial Society.<br/><br/>.<br/>.<br/><br/>If Urban Society stops all its supplies to Villages......Electricity, Oil, Machinery and Equipment, Villagers will survive forever.<br/><br/>If Villages stop all their supplies to Cities......Food Grains and Vegetables, Urban Population will die within a month.<br/><br/>[ Villagers need Electricity, Oil, Machinery and Equipment to produce food for the Urban Population , They would not need these things to produce food for themselves]<br/><br/>Urban Population is engaged in Unnecessary Work, Meaningless Work, Futile Work and Destructive Work which has led to destruction of most of the Biodiversity and Ecosystems on earth.<br/><br/>For millions of years "Searching For Food" / "Producing Food" were the primary occupations of almost the entire human population in Hunter_Gatherer and Agrarian Society.<br/><br/>There is Zero chance of saving the little environment that is left without fixing the problem of "Urban Population".<br/><br/>.<br/>.<br/><br/>Animal Species had Zero Percent Urban Population.......Hunter_Gatherer Society had Zero Percent Urban Population.......Agrarian Society had less than Two Percent Urban Population.......All these societies sustained for millions of years collectively.<br/><br/>The current Industrial Society which has 50% Urban Population worldwide has destroyed most of the Biodiversity and Ecosystems in just 250 years after Industrial Revolution.......Industrial Activity has been promoted by Urban Population......Industrial Activity has been promoted by people who do not produce food.<br/><br/>This planet can sustain Animal Species.....It can sustain Hunter_Gatherer Human Society......It can sustain Agrarian Human Society......It cannot sustain Industrial Human Society.<br/><br/>This planet can only sustain food producing societies where almost the entire population is engaged in food production......It cannot sustain an Industrial Society where 50% of world population is growing food for entire population and the remaining 50% living in cities is promoting Industrial Activity.<br/><br/>Animals saved environment for millions of years because they destroyed it only for food.....Hunter_Gatherer Society saved environment because it destroyed environment only for food.....Agrarian Society saved environment because it destroyed environment only for food, clothing and shelter.<br/><br/>Industrial Society has destroyed most of the Biodiversity and Ecosystems because it destroyed environment for "Thousands of consumer goods and services" in addition to food, clothing and shelter.<br/><br/>In the Animal Kingdom, Hunter_Gatherer Society and Agrarian Society almost the entire population was engaged in "Searching for Food" / "Growing Food".<br/><br/>It is the Urban Population that is engaged in and promoting Industrial Activity ......Mining Industry, Logging Industry, Energy Generation Industry, Manufacturing Industry, Transportation Industry, Construction Industry, Recycling Industry, Oil Drilling, Oil Refining, Millions of kilometers of Rail &amp; Road network, Air Routes and Shipping Lanes…..They all destroy environment......All Industrial Activity must be stopped.<br/><br/>Food, clothing and shelter......These are the maximum number of things this planet can provide to humans......The only way to save the remaining environment is by reorganizing the entire population so that food production remains the only primary activity just like it was for millions of years before Industrialization.<br/><br/>.<br/>.<br/><br/>Industrial Society has existed for barely 250 years which comes to almost Zero Percent of Total Human Existence on earth....Humans have spent more than 99.99% of their time on earth in Non-Industrial Societies [Hunter_Gatherer and Agrarian].....Industrial Society is an Anomaly....Only Non-Industrial Societies are sustainable.<br/><br/>A pure non-industrial society is not possible now because Industrialization has increased world population to 7 billion.......World population increased from 1 billion in 1800 to 7 billion in just about 200 years after industrialization.......In the absence of industrialization world population would have been less than 2 billion today.<br/><br/>If we want to save the remaining environment we must minimize the things that are destroying environment.<br/><br/>At present we are destroying environment for Food, Clothing, Shelter plus Thousands of Industrial consumer goods and services.<br/><br/>We must eliminate the things that were added last to the list......which means Thousands of consumer goods and services, most of which have existed for only about 100 years out of Hundreds of Thousands of years of Total Human Existence on earth .........these have to be eliminated or minimized.<br/><br/>We are approaching Environmental Apocalypse.......The only way to save the remaining environment is by stopping Industrial Activity for production of consumer goods and services immediately........Industrial Activity must be primarily limited to food, clothing and shelter.......and even in these three fields production and consumption must be kept to the minimum.<br/><br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Industrial Society Destroys Mind and Environment</span></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

shelter.<br/>.<br/>.<br/><br/>Animal Species had Zero Percent Urban Population.......Hunter_Gatherer Society had Zero Percent Urban Population.......Agrarian Society had less than Two Percent Urban Population.......All these societies sustained for millions of years collectively.<br/><br/>The current Industrial Society which has 50% Urban Population worldwide has destroyed most of the Biodiversity and Ecosystems in just 250 years after Industrial Revolution.......Industrial Activity has been promoted by Urban Population......Industrial Activity has been promoted by people who do not produce food.<br/><br/>This planet can sustain Animal Species.....It can sustain Hunter_Gatherer Human Society......It can sustain Agrarian Human Society......It cannot sustain Industrial Human Society.<br/><br/>This planet can only sustain food producing societies where almost the entire population is engaged in food production......It cannot sustain an Industrial Society where 50% of world population is growing food for entire population and the remaining 50% living in cities is promoting Industrial Activity.<br/><br/>Animals saved environment for millions of years because they destroyed it only for food.....Hunter_Gatherer Society saved environment because it destroyed environment only for food.....Agrarian Society saved environment because it destroyed environment only for food, clothing and shelter.<br/><br/>Industrial Society has destroyed most of the Biodiversity and Ecosystems because it destroyed environment for "Thousands of consumer goods and services" in addition to food, clothing and shelter.<br/><br/>In the Animal Kingdom, Hunter_Gatherer Society and Agrarian Society almost the entire population was engaged in "Searching for Food" / "Growing Food".<br/><br/>It is the Urban Population that is engaged in and promoting all kinds of Industrial Activity ......Mining Industry, Logging Industry, Energy Generation Industry, Manufacturing Industry, Transportation Industry, Construction Industry, Recycling Industry, Oil Drilling, Oil Refining, Millions of kilometers of Rail &amp; Road network, Air Routes and Shipping Lanes.<br/><br/>Food, clothing and shelter......These are the maximum number of things this planet can provide to humans......The only way to save the remaining environment is by reorganizing the entire population so that food production remains the only primary activity just like it was for millions of years before Industrialization.<br/><br/>.<br/>.<br/><br/>Industrial Society has existed for barely 250 years which comes to almost Zero Percent of Total Human Existence on earth....In fact Industrial Society has existed for only about 100 years....Although Industrial Revolution started 250 years ago most of the world became heavily industrialized only in the last 100 years....100 years of Industrial Activity has destroyed this planet.....100 years of Industrial Activity has destroyed what was not destroyed in millions of years on earth.<br/><br/>Humans have spent more than 99.99% of their time on earth in Non-Industrial Societies [Hunter_Gatherer and Agrarian].....Industrial Society is an Anomaly....Only Non-Industrial Societies are sustainable on earth.<br/><br/>.<br/>.<br/><br/>A pure non-industrial society is not possible now because Industrialization has increased world population to 7 billion.......World population increased from 1 billion in 1800 to 7 billion in just about 200 years after industrialization.......In the absence of industrialization world population would have been less than 2 billion today.<br/><br/>If we want to save the remaining environment we must minimize the things that are destroying environment.<br/><br/>At present we are destroying environment for Food, Clothing, Shelter plus Thousands of Industrial consumer goods and services.<br/><br/>We must eliminate the things that were added last to the list......which means Thousands of consumer goods and services, most of which have existed for only about 100 years out of Hundreds of Thousands of years of Total Human Existence on earth .........these have to be eliminated.<br/><br/>We are approaching Environmental Apocalypse.......The only way to save the remaining environment is by stopping Industrial Activity for production of consumer goods and services immediately........Industrial Activity must be primarily limited to food, clothing and shelter.......and even in these three fields production and consumption must be kept to the minimum.<br/><br/>.<br/>.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">The most dangerous and destructive industry in this world is Education Industry.<br/><br/>Education Industry is the source of all Industrial Activity that has destroyed environment....All other industries are by products of Education Industry.<br/><br/>Universities and Colleges are producing millions of Scientists, Engineers, Economists, MBA's, Business and Finance Graduates who are running and promoting all Industrial Activity in this world.</span><br/><br/>Education Industry is the Mother of all Industries.<br/><br/>Education Industry is the Mother of all Environmental Destruction.<br/><br/>All Industrial Activity that is destroying environment is being run by Scientific, Technological, Industrial, Business and Financial Education.<br/><br/>Education has destroyed environment.<br/><br/>School and University Education has destroyed environment.<br/><br/>Educated People are the biggest Eco Killers, Eco Murderers and Eco Terrorists.<br/><br/>Schools and Universities must be closed down.....Immediately!!!<br/><br/>Billions of animals are being slaughtered in Industrial Slaughter Houses every day because of Education.....Scientific, Technological, Industrial, Business and Financial Education is responsible for Industrial Farming of animals, Industrial Slaughter Houses, Refrigeration/ Transportation Industry which transports live and dead animals all over the world and Marketing Industry which sells meat.<br/><br/>Billions of fish are being killed by Industrial Fishing every day because of Education.....Scientific, Technological, Industrial, Business and Financial Education is responsible for Industrial Ships which catch fish, Refrigeration/ Transportation Industry which transports fish all over the world and Marketing Industry which sells fish.<br/><br/>Millions of acres of Forests are being destroyed by Industrial Activity every day because of Education.....Scientific, Technological, Industrial, Business and Financial Education is responsible for Mining Industry, Logging Industry, Energy Generation Industry, Manufacturing Industry,

moment.<br/><br/>Millions of wild animals in forests are being killed by Industrial Activity every day because of Education....Scientific, Technological, Industrial, Business and Financial Education is responsible for the decimation of wild animals.<br/><br/>Millions of tonnes of Solid, Liquid and Gaseous Industrial Waste is being added to environment every day because of Education.....Millions of tonnes of Metal Waste, Plastic Waste, Chemical waste, Gaseous Waste and eWaste are being added to environment every day because of Education.....Scientific, Technological, Industrial, Business and Financial Education is responsible for the poisoning of Rivers, Oceans, Land and Sky/ Atmosphere.<br/><br/>Millions of acres of Fertile Soil is being killed by Cement, Concrete and Asphalt every day because of Education....Scientific, Technological, Industrial, Business and Financial Education is responsible for destruction of fertile soil by Construction Industry.<br/><br/>Education is responsible for millions of tonnes of Nuclear Waste produced by Nuclear Industry which will keep contaminating the planet with hazardous radioactivity for the next thousands of years.....This radioactivity will remain a potential source of cancer, death, multiple organ failures, physical and mental deformities for thousands of years....Scientific, Technological, Industrial, Business and

goods, Villagers will survive forever.<br/><br/>If Villages stop all their supplies to Cities......Food Grains and Vegetables, Urban Population will die within a month.<br/><br/>[ Villagers need Electricity, Oil, Machinery and Equipment to produce food for the Urban Population , They would not need these things to produce food for themselves]<br/><br/>Industrial Activity for production of thousands of consumer goods and services must stop immediately....Millions of other species get only food from earth....The maximum that man can/ should get is food, clothing and shelter.<br/><br/>This planet can only sustain "Food Searching" or "Food Producing" societies....For millions of years "searching for food"/ "producing food" was the primary occupation on earth.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">The whole society needs to be reorganized...Urban Dwellers have to be relocated in Rural Areas....Urban Dwellers have to either transform into full time food producers or they have to stop working in order to save the remaining environment from destructive Urban Work....They can be given food for free in order to save the remaining environment from destructive Urban Work.<br/></span><br/>.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2">Hi Sushi,<br/>Please consider answering Elijah's question:<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>What exactly is wrong with destroying nature?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Many on this forum disagree that nature is worth preserving. I in particular am especially interested in your opinion, because I think the destruction of nature could be, circumstances permitting, the sole moral deed one can do.<br/><br/>It would also help discussion if you could explain <span style="font-style: italic">why</span> you think the planet is "gasping for its last breath". That is, explain how it is possible to kill the earth, once and for all, and explain why you think we're at the point of no return where the earth cannot be healed. Please, <span style="font-style: italic">do not post your own opinion</span>. It is confusing. Rather, supply us with primary and secondary sources: papers and articles about climate, about resource depletion, irreversible environmental degredation, ecosystem homeostasis and disruption, the evisceration of the ozone by industrial CFCs, the draining of non-renewable aquifers, etc. Perhaps, if you have written a text elsewhere, you can refer us to that. If you have not, please try to answer here as concisely as you can. It would help us a lot.<br/><br/>I look forward to your brief and well-evidenced reply.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
