<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Well, Alan Dawrst is one of the regular posters here, so if you have criticisms he'll be able to respond.<br/><br/>From memory, I thought his reasoning was valid enough, but he uses Vegan Outreach's own claims without reservation, so it probably exaggerates their value. The obvious problem seemed to be that VO were claiming that given that with X leaflets they supposedly cause N people to go vegan, printing Y*X leaflets would cause Y*N people to go vegan. This seems recklessly optimistic to me, for all sorts of reasons.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, it did sound like a good candidate. In the short term, I think Toby has a more comprehensive <a class="postlink" href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/resources/sci-and-deworm-the-world.php">argument</a> for giving to <a class="postlink" href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/schisto/">Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI)</a>.<br/><br/>Toby is quite sanguine about climate change, though, and I'm not convinced by his reasoning on that - vegan outreach seems likely to do more to protect the planet given the severe <a class="postlink" href="../thread/245.html#p1726">environmental impact</a> of meat-eating. In any case, I've emailed Toby, since he's done a lot of recent research on dollar value for GWWC - hopefully he'll stop by.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Arepo, do you know if Toby has given any consideration to how funding health and human development work (such as deworming) would seem to increase meat eating and factory farming? This argument (advanced in a thread elsewhere on this site I think) gives me a little pause, although it is obviously rejected by utilitarians like Singer who have presumably encountered it. Presumably he would say the definite short-term gain in human utility simply outweighs the uncertain long-term increase in animal suffering; although his model (from what I understand) also places a strong value on the human (as opposed to animal) preference to live as opposed to not-live, which I don't really find compelling; dead people have no preferences. This is still quite a vexed question for me (it just seems so counter-intuitive for the potential impact on presumed future animals to outweigh the present and extreme suffering of sick and dying people).<br/><br/>While I ponder this I have been inclined to think VO is the right charity for me at this stage... my only concern is  whether tackling climate change will actually increase utility rather than decrease it (it probably will, but it's so hard to know) and whether reducing meat-eating will allow more wild animals to live and suffer (just possibly, but at any rate outweighed by the importance of spreading the veg*n meme). All this is probably a comment for another thread though...</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Aside from the immediate questions of who we could trust to do such research (from my PoV almost certainly not the macroeconomist charlatans who'd probably end up doing it) and how it's logically possible to know the value of the unknown quantities which the science under research might discern*, how do we really know the potential of the macroresearch? Macromacroresearch? <span style="font-style: italic">Ad infinitum</span>...<br/><br/>*(I'm oversimplifying slightly, but it seems to me that the less you know about these quantities - ie the more research has room to achieve - the less the macroresearch can tell you, and vice versa)<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Is there any other alternative? The only one I can think of is going by unaided intuition, which would seem about as (un)effective as standard politics.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Our intuition isn't unaided though - we have access to all sorts of relevant data. The question is how much <span style="font-style: italic">more </span>aid we should give to our intuition, and then you get back into the regress above.<br/><br/>It seems to me like there's room for a more 'commonsense' approach than many risk theorists would approve of. Where we can already see a clear way of drawing parallels between options (as Toby's studies do), we can do so. Where we can't easily compare between categories (as with VO vs NH vs SCI vs macroresearch) we can use a few heuristics: the clarity of the intracategory data; the methodological proximity to the scientific method of the people who've developed said data; perhaps a direct discussion between people involved in each category where they make their case (preferably peer-reviewed by statisticians who'll guard against the kind of sleights that tend to creep their way into such debates).</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Arepo,<br/><br/>I like Alan's paper. Though it is obviously highly conjectural, I approve of the attempt to quantify the benefits of different ways we could try to improve things. I'm sceptical of some of his numbers, but I don't think they can just be dismissed: we often have to act in the case of incomplete knowledge and need to have a 'best guess' of the expected benefits. That being said, I don't know exactly what to do with such a rough estimate when we also have more accurate estimates of approaches. For example: in the case of human health focused charity, we can produce one QALY for roughly $3 through deworming charities such as SCI or Deworm the World. <br/><br/>See for example <a class="postlink" href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/resources/neglected-tropical-diseases.php">http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/resources/neglected-tropical-diseases.php</a><br/><br/>spindoctor: I've addressed this <a class="postlink" href="../thread/214.html#p1470">http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=214&amp;p=1483#p1470</a></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

And indeed you’re right this was brought up in <a class="postlink" href="../thread/159.html">other</a> <a class="postlink" href="../thread/160.html">forums</a>.<br/><br/>As far as helping wild animals, it’s plausible that VO could be an optimal choice, although I <a class="postlink" href="http://reducing-suffering.blogspot.com/2009/07/reactions-to-animal-suffering.html">fear</a> that most of the veg*ns that the organization creates will side with the conventional “pristine nature should be preserved” meme. You might be better off either (a) saving and investing the money until a real wild-animal-suffering organization is created, or (b) donating to an existing anti-speciesist focused more on pure ideology. (The latter is the option pursued by a friend of mine who shares my strong concern for wild animals.)</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

But it is very influenced by Gary Francione, who thinks "<a class="postlink" href="http://www.pensataanimal.net/painel/138-devemos-intervir-na-predacao/333-gary-l-francione">as a general matter, we ought to leave wild animals alone</a>". So I suppose it rejects ethical interventions in the wild.<br/><br/>I know another anti-speciesist charities in Spain and South-America, and some of their members care about wild-animal suffering (although a few of them are <span style="font-style: italic">in the closet</span>). If someone wants to donate to a Spanish or South-American charity, I can recommend a few with a personal message.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><a class="postlink" href="http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/08/cbr/">Jeff Kaufman</a> wrote a fascinating commentary on my essay: "<a class="postlink" href="http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/08/cbr/news/2011-11-10.html">Estimating Charity Effectiveness: Vegan Outreach</a>."<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The main part [of Alan Dawrst's Vegan Outreach calculation] that seemed high was his estimate of how cheaply Vegan Outreach 'makes' vegetarians. [...]<br/><br/>cost of a vegetarian-year = 1/(b*v*s*t) = $16.5 to $0.09<br/><br/>I decided to try and get an alternate estimate, calculating through Vegan Outreach's revenue and the number of vegetarians.<br/><br/>There are around 7M vegetarians in the US and 10% say "animal rights" is their main reason (<a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism_in_specific_countries#USA">wikipedia</a>). At the high end, I would put Vegan Outreach's work at being responsible for 1/4 of these people, and at the low end I'd say maybe around 1/500. [...]<br/><br/>cost of a vegetarian year = m/(n*a*r) = $4.29 to $536<br/><br/>I think the main reason my cost estimate comes out much higher is Alan's estimate for s, the fraction of people who stay vegetarian. I know more lapsed vegetarians than vegetarians, so I think 100% is definitely too high, but 30% may also be. I'm also not so sure about v. They seem amenable to measurement, but I don't think anyone's done that.<br/></div></blockquote><br/><br/>Thanks for the insightful analysis, Jeff! It's great to see that the figures at least come out in a similar ballpark with two largely independent methods of calculation.<br/><br/>Using Jeff's ranges, a dollar donated to Vegan Outreach prevents between 3 days and and 1.05 years of direct factory-farm suffering.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

(The 0th percentile is negative infinity for any action whatsoever. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/>)<br/><br/>Of course, rather than playing around with percentiles too much, we could just focus on what matters: the expected value.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>RyanCarey wrote:</cite>And then the fraction of animal rights vegetarians who were once converted by Vegan Outreach being 1/4 or 1/500? I think if you did a straw poll of how many animal rights vegetarians had so much as heard of Vegan Outreach, the figure would still be &lt;1%.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>I recall a story that at an animal-rights conference, a speaker asked how many people in the audience were there because of Vegan Outreach's influence, and about 20% raised their hands. That said, (a) this estimate is likely high due to selection bias in repeating that story, (b) it's not obvious that all the audience members understood the question correctly, and (c) we don't know if the percent of animal-welfare-motivated vegetarians influenced by Vegan Outreach is as high as it is for animal activists.<br/><br/>As far as suspecting my estimate to be too high, I think the main culprit is <br/><br/>"v = the fraction of b who become vegetarian or vegan who wouldn't otherwise have done so = 0.43% to 2.5%,"<br/><br/>which seems a bit too big even in light of Vegan Outreach's testimonials quoted in my article.<br/><br/>Of course, this can bleed over into "s = the fraction of v who stay vegetarian or vegan" depending on how you define "a vegetarian or vegan." Someone who tries skipping meat for one day only could be classified into the negative category for v or for s.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
