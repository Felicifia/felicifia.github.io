<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">If and when a new Tory government is elected in the UK, it is possible they may overturn Labour's ban on ye ancient and noble sporte of foxhunting.<br/><br/>But what do utilitarians have to say about this prima facie cruel sport? It occurs to me that the painful death of the fox has to be counterbalanced against saving 30 or 40 rabbits and voles from the painful death of being eaten alive, not to mention saving the fox itself from perhaps a more lingering death by winter cold or starvation. On the other hand -- killing the fox allows its prey to live and in turn suffer from sickness, misadventure and dying. How does one weigh up an action like this which has such complex positive and negative impacts?<br/><br/>(I'm interested specifically in the question above, but I think that utilitarians should probably support the foxhunting ban regardless because it contributes to the vital meme that animal suffering matters).</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Coherence is part of attractiveness. There are two elements of coherence. The first is utilitarianism needs to appear coherent to utilitarians. That is, it needs to be based on evidence and utility. The latter is that utilitarianism needs to appear coherent to non-utilitarians. The implications of this latter type are:<br/>&gt; whether or not utilitarianism actually increases happiness, it should appear as though it is. <br/>&gt; whether or not utilitarians actually improve animal wellbeing, they should perform activities that look as though they assist animals.<br/>and so on.<br/><br/>There is a strong analogy between the communication of utilitarianism and the communication of policy. Allow me to explain. Suppose a left-wing government is percieved as soft on immigration. They might make a token gesture of toughness by turning around one or two immigrating boats. This particular event appears contrary to the left-wing ideology. However, it contributes to the government's attractiveness, which increases the popularity of its policy. Coming back to utilitarianism, utilitarian support for a ban on fox-hunting would be just that sort of token gesture. Although it might appear contrary to utilitarian goals, in the long run, it will actually help us to cut through to our target audience. Of course, as we sacrifice hard-line utilitarian positions, we must ensure that the utilitarianism that we sell to the masses remains preferable to the alternative.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

It seems quite obvious that removing predator species will lead to more of their prey ('obvious' in a slightly guarded sense that sudden changes to ecological systems are notoriously unpredictable), but so what?

Seems sensible... although presumably you want to be choosey about which demographic you want it to be popular among - some room for research on which area of society you find people most likely to become utilitarians if they're not already, perhaps? <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Clearly there isn't always a balancing effect -- getting rid of predators can allow more prey to flourish. Which is why I said that if the lives of small mammals have net utility in the absence of predators -- that's a big if, but it's certainly arguable, since they may have longer deaths but they also have longer lives in which to experience pleasure -- there may be a gain in utility by getting rid of predators. The more developed brains of predators, and the harder work that prey have to do in the absence of population control, may both be offset by the fact that there are numerically far more sentient individuals experiencing utility than there were before.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Ok, fair enough - I guess I was thinking more of conscious biomass. <br/><br/>I still think all the 'mights' in the equation amount to the same - Alan would argue for similar reasons to you that insect suffering is possibly the world's biggest source of net utility, but I find such claims unconvincing, mainly since emotion is much less useful to more basic organisms than it seems to be to us. If we can accurately simulate the behaviour of an organism on a non-sentient computer it seems to me that evolution can program insects just as effectively and with no need for sentience.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Any overall good treatment of individual animals on the long run will, necessarily and logically, be a result of honestly wanting to treat animals better. The real interest of wanting to treat wild animals better will necessarily go first through a stage of non-interventionism with the nation of the wild: just like an exploited colony needs to separate themselves, state their independence, before they engage in positive relationships with previously conflicting nations, so will be the case with the nation of the wild in regards to the nation of the humans.<br/><br/>Thus the sooner in the present we support non-interventionism in the wild, the sooner we will build up respect towards animals and the sooner truly good interventionism will follow in the future. Without animal rights, any consequences of our actions that happen to be good to wild animals are overall more arbitrary than headed towards doing good.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">As far as the issue of taking popular positions vs. correct positions, it seems to me utilitarians should basically just ignore these issues altogether: We have limited time and resources in which to communicate messages, so let's just talk about the high-value causes and ignore these side issues (just as politicians often reply to trivial questions by bringing the discussion back to their preferred sound bites).<br/><br/>Regarding insect sentience, I'll just include a link to <a class="postlink" href="../thread/258.html">this more recent thread</a> on the topic. In particular, I'd encourage reading the quotes in the "<a class="postlink" href="http://discovermagazine.com/2007/jan/cockroach-consciousness-neuron-similarity">Consciousness in a Cockroach</a>" piece. The commonality of brain systems across organisms at varying levels of complexity seems to me a rather important point. Consider also, e.g., the behavioral evidence in <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/insect-pain.html">these Donald Griffin</a> quotes.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
