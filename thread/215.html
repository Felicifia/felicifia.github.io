<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Mindful of the suffering caused by the dairy industry, I am considering cutting cheese out of my otherwise mostly-vegan diet. <br/><br/>The problem: vegan cheese substitutes are very expensive, perhaps twice as expensive or more than the real thing. I am not ready at this stage to cut out cheese (real or faux) altogether. So do I pay through the nose for the luxury vegan version, or do I continue to eat inexpensive real cheese and divert the money saved to Vegan Outreach (for example)? Alan Dawrst has written on his <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/dollar-worth.pdf">site</a> about how incredibly cost effective even a small donation to Vegan Outreach can be -- saving animals from potentially many years of factory farming. Over the course of a year, diverting money spent on vegan luxuries could potentially convert 30+ people to veganism.<br/><br/>Of course, this ignores the fact that it is good to create a market for vegan food (in order to bring the price down and make it easier to become a vegan) plus it is important to act as an example to others. Any thoughts?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

In other words, if you start buying fake cheese, it's total market will have an expected increase of something like 1.1 people.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">On the other hand, a (reluctantly?) converted vegan mightn't be as persuasive as Spindoctor. <br/><br/>Furthermore, you'd want to go through the detail of Alan's article. I've had a very breif look. Here's Alan's bottom line:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>In other words, a single dollar donated to Vegan Outreach is expected to prevent between 100 days and 51 years of suffering on a factory farm.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I gather he estimates that 5 individuals are converted to veganism per 200 brochures. Somewhere between 30% and 100% of them stay vegan. Those that stay vegan save animals' lives for a couple of decades on average, when in vitro meat apparently starts to take over.<br/><br/>As I've said, I haven't looked at the detail of his essay, but surely more realistic estimates would be:<br/>1/200 converted<br/>sustained, on average, for 1 year. (a few sustain it for a lifetime, but most keep up veganism for a few months tops. Alan, then, could be out by a factor of a hundred...<br/><br/>Furthermore, might vegan outreach alienate some of the general public?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">There is also the very real risk that the money saved on the vegan substitute cheese won't actually get diverted to Vegan Outreach. I may have that intention now but in practice it may well not happen without careful monitoring -- it's perhaps more likely I will just pick a donation figure out of the air (which may not differ much from what I would have given anyway).<br/><br/>I faced the same kind of dilemma with street children in Cambodia -- kids will hawk paperbacks around the tourist areas of Phnom Penh, hoping to offload them for $1-$2 each. An expat told me that selling several books helps them pay for that week's schooling (not sure how true that is). Peter Singer's position on begging is that he saves up the money he would have given to street people and donates it to Oxfam in a lump sum at the end of the year. I am satisfied that Singer has the organisational nous to arrange this. Can't say the same for myself.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">One more thought...there's could also be something to be said for hard boundaries, not fuzzy ones.<br/><br/>I'm thinking here of the Gary Francione animal rights/animal abolitionist approach. For them, über-strict veganism is the "moral baseline", to the extent that when they mention Vegan Outreach they use scare quotes around the 'Vegan' [I still haven't worked that out -- I think it's because they dare to suggest that omnivores can work their way towards veganism gradually by cutting out meat/dairy?]. Francione gleefully castigates Singer for daring to call himself a vegan when he admits to sometimes eating dairy-based ghee in Indian curries at a restaurant. <br/><br/>In spite of my differences with that approach, it has some strategic benefits I think. Like setting hard boundaries -- no dairy cheese, full stop. Living by that rule of thumb may mean lots of reckless spending on Soy Chreeze...but it also makes eating and shopping clear, simple and uncompromising. Whereas there's a strong potential for a slippery slope if you allow vegans to indulge in a kind of carbon-offset scheme with their cheese-eating. They might fall off the wagon. It also threatens the intellectual coherence of the vegan movement (since most people don't think like utilitarians).<br/><br/>In a related point, I think Gary Francione and his lobby may have a point when it comes to criticising Singer on veganism. In many of the recent interviews I've seem him give on this, he's taken a very hands-off, Yoda-esque "do or not do" position on veganism. He'll say vegetarian is good, choosing free-range is good if you want to keep eating meat, and yeah become a vegan if you can manage it. His messages on ethical eating are so damn pussyfied that you could watch a Singer interview and come away thinking you were saving the world just because you chose the free-range scrambled eggs at the cafe. I think he needs to get back to his old-school, moral compass approach -- bold and uncompromising -- "by eating meat and dairy you personally make a major contribution to animal suffering". It was that kind of conversation that won me over. Whereas, as the Francione mob says, his more palatable offerings of late kind of add to the general impression that being a vegan is a rather out-there practice only to be attempted by extremist ascetics.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><span style="font-weight: bold">About the general problem</span><br/>This is an interesting and important question. In the most extreme theoretical cases it could even have radical implications. If the differences in magnitudes of expected utility from donating to a cause and eating vegan oneself (including talking to others about it, being a role model, etc) are big enough it could even be justified to go on eating meat. There is always some cost (initial or continous), in time, money or willpower to making a change in one's life. The crucial factors here (except the utility comparision) one's ability to divert different types of resources to different ends.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">The specific question: Private consumption among utilitarians</span><br/>Spindoctor, I agree with your original reasoning, DanieLC and RyanCarey. At least for someone who is a member of the utilitarian minority it seems better to spend the money on an effective cause like Vegan Outreach, rather than on more costsome cheese-substitutes. Of course, as has been pointed out, this assumes the money won't be spent in some non-utilitarian way. <br/><br/>One way to ensure that the money is spent the right way would be to keep a strict budget, including categories like food, necessities, utilitarian causes, and fun. With such a budget the cheese choice would manifest itself as the question whether resources should be moved from the utilitarian category to the food category or not. Such a strict budget could also help to avoid the risk of a slippery slope.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Rhetorics</span><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>On the other hand, a (reluctantly?) converted vegan mightn't be as persuasive as Spindoctor. </div></blockquote><br/><br/>Probably only a small fraction of one's persuasiveness depends on whether one eats vegan cheese or not. And with out good evidence we cannot even sure if not eating vegan cheese will make a positive or negative contribution to one's persuasiveness. Strictness might persuade some, but it may also frighten others. To know which effect is bigger we need quantitative data.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Effectiveness of vegan outreach?</span><br/>The question here shouldn't be whether VO is more effective, but whether there is *any* utilitarian cause that is more cost-effective (for example, investing in <a class="postlink" href="http://www.new-harvest.org/support.htm">in-vitro meat research</a>). This also includes the alternative of investing (link?) the money and waiting for knowledge about what the best cause would be while letting the money grow. So to be the favoured utilitarian alternative spending money on veganism for oneself would have to trump all possible ways of spending money for the rest of one's (utilitarian) lifetime.<br/><br/>In fact, after looking at some statistics of veganism and vegetarianism I'd say that the future looks pretty bleak if it really would be the case that changing private consumption would be the best way of using utilitarian resources. That is, from the statistics I've seen it seems like the increase of veganism/vegetarianism has been small if not non-existent <a class="postlink" href="http://www.imaner.net/panel/statistics.htm#reveal">the last 15 years</a>.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Spindoctor, I don't think hard-line vegans are doing anyone any favours. You're right that their messages are coherent. 'slavery is wrong' is coherent and effective in today's western societies for example. For another example, 'god is a delusion' is a fairly coherent argument, but is it persuasive? I think the 'meat is murder' line does not sell vegetarianism well at all. It might 'energise the support-base' for veganism but it's not the message that you want to broadcast to the masses. What you want to broadcast to the masses is surely something more like this: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.meatfreemondays.co.uk/">http://www.meatfreemondays.co.uk/</a>. Try cutting meat out of your diet for one day per week. See what it does for your health, your budget and the environment!<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Jesper Östman wrote:</cite>One way to ensure that the money is spent the right way would be to keep a strict budget</div></blockquote><br/>I think this is key.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Jesper Östman wrote:</cite>In fact, after looking at some statistics of veganism and vegetarianism I'd say that the future looks pretty bleak if it really would be the case that changing private consumption would be the best way of using utilitarian resources.

You would want to poll the particular university at which vegan outreach campaigned. If, as you say, the popularity of veganism is stable, that's perfectly compatible with the idea that Vegan outreach is cost-effective. Veganism could still be dwindling but doing better than would otherwise be the case, thanks to vegan outreach.<br/><br/>Having said this, I agree with your other point. It's not about vegan outreach compared with vegan cheese. It's about the best charity utilitarianism has to offer compared with vegan cheese.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">RyanCarey, I agree that the hard-line vegan lobby get their messaging completely wrong. Freak-outs over trace ingredients and telling people that an egg is a "chicken's period" just tags them as nutters in most people's eyes.<br/><br/>I'm not advocating that. But I do think there's a place for AR proponents to talk in a calm, compelling reasoned way about the moral implications of factory farming. Singer has a unique ability to do this -- he's converted hundreds of thousands to veg*nism by talking gently but directly about the ethics of food. Seems like a dubious tactical decision for him to adopt a more laissez-faire tone now when his former approach was so incredibly effective. <br/><br/>The AR movement really needs two quite distinct messages for two different demographics. One, the Meat-Free Mondays approach, should aim to get committed meat-eaters to reduce their consumption incrementally, largely for health or environmental reasons. The other quite different campaign focuses on animal suffering and aims to create ethical veg*ns.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
