What are yours/those of other utilitarians you know/the overall split, if you can hazard a guess?<br/><br/>For my part, I'm left of centre in that I think the state/society should, if it can, intervene to promote general welfare, and that the lowest cost ways of doing so will help the poor disproportionately. And I think that it can, as many elements of the welfare state have net positive utility, public heathcare can be more efficient than a pure private model, etc. The fact that as a utilitarian I don't believe in natural property rights (which I think most people do) also marks me out as more left-wing. But I'm somewhat convinced by the benefits of free markets as being (in most cases) one of the best means for achieving these 'progressive' ends. And as a utilitarian I don't believe that equality is <span style="font-style: italic">intrinsically</span> valuable either.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

(even before accounting for the numbing effect of politics on intelligence)<br/>2) because even in cases where we can apparently be confident of large differences between parties, political involvement still seems suboptimal from both a <a class="postlink" href="../thread/181.html">utilitarian</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/12/voting-kills.html">self-interested</a> perspective.<br/><br/>In theory I'm as social liberal as the rest of us and somewhere in the centre on economics, but I have very low confidence in my conclusions.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">I put myself as libertarian, but I don't know how accurate that is.<br/><br/>I am for some wealth redistribution, as I believe the way it all works out naturally is arbitrary. That is, the people who contribute will always get more, but how much more they get is dependent on the way the economy works. For example, mass production allows poor people to get a higher proportion.<br/><br/>I suspect that the natural distribution is too much for the rich and little for the poor, but wealth redistribution is biased the opposite direction.<br/><br/>Subsidies and taxes are an effective way to deal with externalities, but given the government's track record for them, I think it would probably be better to do without except in extreme circumstances. Also, it should be limited to taxes and subsidies i.e. nothing should be entirely illegal unless it's really extreme, like actually attacking someone.<br/><br/>I am for the government heavily taxing animal cruelty e.g. factory farming and animal testing (I'm for animal testing, but only if it's important enough that they'd be willing to pay the tax)<br/><br/>I'm not sure about foreign aid. Theoretically, it's good, but I've heard the government is really, really bad at it.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">I really don't fit. <br/><br/>I'd start off by saying that I'm liberal on all social issues, whereas I'm conservative in wanting to balance a budget. I'm environmentalist. So overall I'm fairly leftist. <br/><br/>But I'd alienate myself from most leftists on a couple of counts. Firstly, leftists always talk of "closing the gap", I take issue with that phrase. We shouldn't try to equalise wealth, or health or wellbeing. We should try to lift it. Make the poor richer, and make the rich richer, dont' close the gap! On a similar note, leftists always want to reduce taxes for relatively poor Australians, or Englishmen, or Americans. Well poor westerners are still rich by global standards. We don't need to redistribute wealth within our contries. If we were series about redistribution of wealth, we'd do it internationally. We'd care for the poor - the absolutely poor - in Africa, mostly. Charity doesn't start at home, contrary to the beliefs of most leftists.<br/><br/>I guess I'm aligned with libertarians on some topics, though not all.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I'm conservative in wanting to balance a budget</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Just a minor note - I'm not sure there's any good reason to lump this with other conservative policies. A balanced high-tax budget doesn't seem conservative, even just in respect of being balanced.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>We don't need to redistribute wealth within our contries.

I suspect, given that many leftists are (often closeted) internationalists, that in some cases it's simply because that's more politically viable, given the average voter's more likely to feel solidarity with and want to help people in their community. In other circumstances it's probably because this hasn't occurred to them. In yet others it may be because their primary motive really isn't welfarist, but about wanting to build a non-capitalist society or somesuch.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Surely we’re interested in how good they are relative to some alternative option... the obvious comparison to me would be whether they’re better than the same amount of money (plus the admin cost of the government getting it) in the possession of citizens of the country in question. In that case it seems to me that the bar is pretty low – few people will give as much as 5% of their income to things they consider good causes, and of those causes many will be massively inefficient or even counter-productive (cf for example two contradictory charities – the National Rifle Association Foundation and the Brady Campaign).</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

A minimum wage? Unemployment benefits (conditional on seeking a job) of £4000 a year to take the UK figure (possibly plus free housing)?

It helps the people who have jobs, but makes it harder for others to get jobs. There's no reason to eliminate jobs that aren't that valuable.<br/><br/>The problem with unemployment benefits is that they effectively make a job worth that much less. If you have a job offer worth £8000 a year, and unemployment benefits of £4000 a year, the job effectively only pays £4000 a year, and it's the worse £4000 a year. Worse, if you're offered a job worth less than £4000 a year, it's never worth while to take it. Perhaps it would work if they made it easy to offer one of those people jobs, and they had to take it, provided it's worth at least the unemployment.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I'm still in school, and I have no concept of how much money is worth, so I have no way of answering directly. You should be able to live on it, but not very comfortably. Perhaps it would be best to make it so you're just given (bad) lodging and food, or possibly just live outside if that doesn't work out too badly.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>A more central question than the above: why as a utilitarian should you limit yourself to considering externalities, as opposed to all the positive and negative consequences, including those for the smoker?</div></blockquote><br/>Generally, people don't deal with stuff happening to other people as well as stuff happening to themselves. This is why you need to worry about externalities in the first place. If politicians control what you do, this goes from you controlling what happens to yourself to them controlling what happens to someone else.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
