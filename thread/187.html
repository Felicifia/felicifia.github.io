<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Here's an issue that might divide hedonistic from preference utils. Suppose someone started researching a procedure which extended life by 10% iff they committed to it quite early in life, but reduced the happiness of the person taking it by 15% per year thereafter (or rather by a sufficient amount to ensure that their total life's happiness would be lower if they underwent it).<br/><br/>People having evolved to survive whatever the cost, it seems likely that many, perhaps most would undergo it. For hedonistic utilitarians, that's a pretty bad outcome, in itself. We would probably prefer the procedure weren't developed. <br/><br/>This might not be hypothetical. Here's a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.practicalethicsnews.com/practicalethics/2009/07/hunger-for-long-life-the-ethics-of-caloric-restriction-experiments.html#more">piece by Anders Sandberg</a> (reposted with standing permission from the author):<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>This has been a good week for life extension research, with the Nature paper '<a class="postlink" href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7253/pdf/nature08221.pdf">Rapamycin fed late in life extends lifespan in genetically heterogeneous mice</a>' by Harrison et al. (free <a class="postlink" href="http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090708/full/news.2009.648.html">News and Views</a>) showing that the drug boosts lifespan in middle aged mice, and Science countering with <a class="postlink" href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/325/5937/201">Caloric Restriction Delays Disease Onset and Mortality in Rhesus Monkeys</a> by Colman et al. showing that in a 20-year longitudinal study rhesus monkeys do seem to benefit from caloric restriction (CR). CR involves keeping the energy intake low, but not so low that it induces starvation.<br/><br/>Not everybody seems to like the experiment. The Swedish major newspaper Dagens Nyheter had an <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dn.se/nyheter/vetenskap/apor-pa-svaltkost-ar-friska-langre-1.908430">article by Per Snaprud</a> that appeared to criticise the monkey experiment on ethical grounds. He quotes Mats Spångberg, chief veterinarian at the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control, who doubts the experiment would have been approved in Sweden. The only use of monkeys in Swedish research is AIDS vaccine research. The article concludes by stating that the virus kills 2 million people every year, 270,000 of whose are children.<br/><br/>But ageing kills 100,000 people worldwide each day directly or indirectly. 100% of humans and monkeys are "infected".<br/><br/>It should be noted that a few studies of caloric restriction in humans have been done, as well as quasi-experiments like the frugal diet of Okinawa. The mainproblem is that humans are so long-lived that it is hard to draw strong conclusions from them. The real benefit from CR research will likely be a better understanding of the mechanisms of ageing and possibly "CR mimetics", drugs that trigger the same anti-ageing response as reduced food intake. Real CR is simpy too impractical for weak-willed humans in a world of culinary delights.<br/><br/>It might be factually true that caloric restriction monkey experiments are unlikely to be approved in Sweden for cultural and institutional reasons, but ethically it seems to me that the case for the experiment is strong. The need for understanding and limiting the ravages of aging is enormous when measured in lives lost (not to mention suffering and loss of human capital). If one doesn't think it is worth finding ways of slowing or at least understand aging (as DN journalist Hanne Kjöller seems to argue in an opinion piece today) if it reduces the life quality of the monkeys, then one should give serious consideration of not trying to find an AIDS vaccine either. After all, it is a smaller problem.<br/><br/>The persistent hunger likely experienced by the monkeys is presumably not too different from what monkeys would experience in the wild where food access is haphazard. If the monkeys in the CR experiment have lives worth living - which seems to be the case - the extension of these lives adds value.<br/><br/>This is true even if the life quality is somewhat lowered by hunger compared to monkeys who can eat as much as they like. It seems unlikely that the value of the longer life and reduction of illness can be completely offset by plain hunger (especially since older monkeys in the experiment with chronic conditions like diabetes get <a class="postlink" href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/data/325/5937/201/DC1/1">medical treatment</a>). If one were to seriously believe chronic hunger to be so bad that it reduces quality of life below worth living, one should give serious thought about feeding as many wild animals as possible and kill the rest. Or invite them into the lab, where they would at least get medical treatment.<br/><br/>Many people suffer from <a class="postlink" href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/hw/scope_insensitivity/">scope insensitivity</a> and the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic">availability heuristic</a> when it comes to ageing compared to other conditions. They do not see how much pervasive suffering it causes, and they put more emphasis on comparatively rarer causes of mortality that stand out. The result is that they try to <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_justification">justify the current situation</a>, allowing the carnage to go on.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I'm less convinced than Anders that chronic hunger won't reduce the monkeys' lives below the net positive point, and I'd like to see some evidence before I believe that the monkeys suffer more in the wild. But that's not really the point. (I also think the Rapamycin report sounds good - I'm interested in the other news here)<br/><br/>For a hedonistic util, therapies which a) reduce net happiness and b) are likely to be widely used, are not therapies we want to spend resources on developing. It might even be worth trying to prevent their development.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">I consider myself a prioritarian of sorts on both of these compasses. In the first I would probably be in the bottom-right quadrant. In the second, the bottom-left. (Perhaps charting where we are visually would be useful... and fun)<br/><br/>The negative vs positive prioritarian approach is more generally understood, so I shouldn't need to go into that.<br/><br/>I don't know if there are any formalized concepts which present consequentialism as a spectrum, but I think it should be obvious that it is. I also think that almost any real live utilitarian, as opposed to homo utilitarianus, would agree that if an equal and indivisible amount of utility were to be added to the faceless aggregate utility, it would be best for it to be added to yourself. (note: this is different from it being added to someone you know or can see, which could in turn provide you with utility)<br/><br/>I think that "Enlightened" Egoism (and Enlightened Altruism) often looks indistinguishable from Utiltiarianism, and so I think the biggest battle is getting people to accept any form of consequentialism, and then prodding them to be as enlightened about it as possible.... and even the utilitarians need quite a bit of enlightenment to keep us from the very human mistake of mixing up the means and the ends via routinization.<br/><br/>On the Preference Utilitarian vs Hedonism debate, I think it is possible to think that while there is some universal characteristics of happiness, because of certain epistemological uncertainty (our inability to experience the qualia of other minds) and in the interests of preserving self-sovereignty and the harm principle, it is best to err on the preference side.<br/><br/>Does this make sense?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">In principle, there may be tradeoffs between extending maximal life spans and increasing aggregate happiness.  In practice, however, prolonging lives will very likely promote welfare as well.  At least two considerations support this claim.<br/><br/>First, death causes vast amounts of suffering to those close to the person deceased.  If people live longer, there will be, <span style="font-style: italic">ceteris paribus</span>, fewer deaths, and hence less suffering.  Secondly, and more importantly, increases in maximal life spans will extend the scope of self-regarding concern, thereby expanding the time horizon of projects for which human wills may be mobilized.  This is critical in relation to the risk of human extinction.  In light of the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/Reports/2008-1.pdf">best estimates available</a>, achieving even modest results in life-extension would mean that the risk of extinction becomes a greater threat to individual lives than the risk of stroke.  Under such circumstances, the general population is likely to take existential risks much more seriously, and as a result active measures will be taken to reduce those risks.  Given the astronomical instrumental value that attaches to the survival of our species, prolonging the lives of its individual members may well be one of the most effective strategies available for maximizing the sum total of happiness in the Universe.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote><div><cite>Benthamite wrote:</cite>First, death causes vast amounts of suffering to those close to the person deceased. If people live longer, there will be, ceteris paribus, fewer deaths, and hence less suffering. Secondly, and more importantly, increases in maximal life spans will extend the scope of self-regarding concern, thereby expanding the time horizon of projects for which human wills may be mobilized. This is critical in relation to the risk of human extinction. In light of the best estimates available, achieving even modest results in life-extension would mean that the risk of extinction becomes a greater threat to individual lives than the risk of stroke. Under such circumstances, the general population is likely to take existential risks much more seriously, and as a result active measures will be taken to reduce those risks. Given the astronomical instrumental value that attaches to the survival of our species, prolonging the lives of its individual members may well be one of the most effective strategies available for maximizing the sum total of happiness in the Universe.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Hey Pablo, glad to see you on here. I'll now disagree with you vigorously <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/><br/><br/>(Actually, not that vigorously.) I agree that your points are considerations, but I don't see any reason to think they outweigh forces pulling in the opposite direction - eg. increased resource pressure (this problem will provably be exacerbated proportionately to the amount of extra person-years life extension technology creates), and as a foil to your latter point, people are pathologically concerned with self-protection for its own sake, so encouraging them to concern themselves with it more might make us more narcissistic, less willing to trade our own wellbeing for others'.<br/><br/>Re 'best estimates', I'm extremely sceptical. These are just numbers invented by people who know fractionally more about certain specific issues than the average person. If they had any insight, then those of us who're reasonably logically capable but less well informed ought to have the same insight but with slightly less precision. But it seems clear my estimate of the likelihood of events they describe is so massively imprecise (somewhere between .000001 and .99 might just cover it, albeit shifting rapidly towards the lower extreme as you fill in specifics) that they would have to be hyperintelligent AIs themselves to have improved on my guesstimate by the amount they're suggesting. So they're not scientific, nor supported by a history of successful predictions by futurists...<br/><br/>They're also weakly self-contradictory, in that, if we take them as expressions of probability, the probability of an AI killing a billion people is the same as that of it killing 6-10 billion people, which is obviously false.<br/><br/>(I also still don't agree with you on the significance of human extinction - I'm still intending to reply to your email about that at some point)<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>DanielLC wrote:</cite>I don't see what you mean by people living longer meaning fewer deaths. There is exactly one death per person. You would just be putting it off.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Yes, but if you assume that it takes one person year requires <span style="font-style: italic">n</span> resources, with life extension fewer people are born and fewer people die. Thus people have a lower ratio of normal life:grief caused by deaths.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Also, there was a section on killing by a super-intelligent AI. I'd put the probability of even developing an AI that fast as far lower, and I have yet to see a reason why one would feel the need to kill humans. Especially considering it would, in all probability, be built to serve humans.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>The way people who take the risk seriously have described this to me, 'feeling' is besides the point. They fear computer programmers giving a new program any innocuous command - 'derive all primes' or something similar - and the program then converting the entire Earth, and perhaps beyond, into forms of energy or matter that help it in its task. In which case it might start with anyone who might be able to stop it, since it can work out that the risk of them stopping it is the greatest impediment to achieving the goal it's been given.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
