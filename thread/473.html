<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Greetings all, I've just registered for the forums. I'm a 20 year old American college student living in North Carolina. I've had quite an intellectual journey through my life, starting out as an Taoist-styled anarchist/libertarian, and then becoming heavily involved in Marxism. I've been a Utilitarian for more than seven years now, an ethic I've found both personally fulfilling and frustratingly misunderstood by those around me in both academic and social contexts.<br/><br/>I've come to Felificia to connect with like minded individuals, and perhaps more importantly, find and start efforts to spread the philosophy. I recognize that for many Utilitarianism is a more personal or esoteric experience. However I hope that this community will, among other things, help me find other people hoping to make "the greatest happiness for the greatest number" the common answer to the question "what is right?"</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Thanks for the info Ryan. I will definitely look into adding to the wiki as a good place to start. I've applied to the Wiki Facebook group, and hopefully I'll get to know some of the people here and the Facebook contacts will grow. <br/><br/>As to my start, though the answer admittedly may seem cliche, I think I was always utilitarian at heart - that is to say, I think I always had the central concept as my goal, even before I could express it as succinctly and directly as I can now. As we all know, more or less every ethical argument that has public traction is based on Utilitarian values; if you ask "but why is that right" enough times, you'll get there. But anyway, I came to "Utilitarianism Proper" in part thanks to my brother, who's working on his PhD in Economics right now, but primarily from analyzing and debating policies with other people. I read Bentham 7 years ago, and was sold ever since.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Is it a metaphor about orientating yourself towards a utilitarian goal no matter where life takes you?<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>southpointingchariot wrote:</cite>My parents are devout Christians, but have always encouraged me to think reasonably and investigate and follow what is right.</div></blockquote> I admire that so much - that's the first story I've heard of Christian parents encouraging their child to think reasonably and follow what is right over just following Christianity.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>southpointingchariot wrote:</cite>I think there's definitely value to what you're saying, especially in the short term. But I think we sell ourselves short by not trying to bring utilitarianism to the masses. Time will tell.</div></blockquote> Interesting. I'm still not sure what the best approach is.<br/>I think there's a danger with specifying <span style="font-style: italic">any</span> complete normative theory to which you adhere, because people then tend to search for the areas where you disagree and exaggerate your differences. It's the same with politicians or charities - if a politician/charity does things you support 90% of the time, and things you don't 10% of the time, the average person would rather support a politician/charity that did things they like 100% of the time, even if they did it far less effectively. Same with religions (heckles tend to raise when a Christian tells an atheist that they're a Christian, even if deep down the atheist thinks that the Christian is actually better than the average person as a result).<br/>"When the s*** hits the fan, everyone's a utilitarian." When people are forced to make tough decisions, they will often choose the utilitarian option. But very rarely will people admit this is in everyday life - they just won't give an answer to those tough moral dilemmas, and think that makes them morally superior to the utilitarian.<br/>By the way, Charity International were an explicitly utilitarian organisation and they've now become "Global Happiness Organisation" and don't call themselves utilitarian.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite> I can point you to six people </div></blockquote> I'm curious...why six?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
