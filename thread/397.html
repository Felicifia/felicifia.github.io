<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">I am interested in the most effective ways of converting people to become vegetarian or vegan (veg*n). <br/>People are often different, and there may be a need for a few different approaches to getting people to become more/completely vegetarian/vegan, but it is likely that some people (college students?) on average are easier to convince, and some approaches/arguments are better at the task. I would like to hear people's suggestions based on personal experience and preferably scientific research.<br/><br/>1) <span style="font-weight: bold">What kind of individuals are more likely to become veg*n?</span><br/>2) <span style="font-weight: bold">What are some of the best approaches you know of making someone veg*n?</span><br/><br/>Of all the vegetarians/vegans I've interacted with (almost all college students/graduates), they all seem to have ethical treatment of animals as the basis of their (non)action, though my sample is not representative of the population. I'd be curious to know what the primary reasons vegetarians have for joining and for sticking to not eating meat (I suspect the two answers may diverge). Answering this question may point to answers to the two questions.<br/><br/>It may be best to follow the approaches various animal rights organizations take to influence people. Though they mostly make and try to popularize videos and spread leaflets, the reasons they focus on these activities may simply be that these are cheap, easy to do (etc), not because they are most effective. Though I do suspect the two activities may be some of the best ways to spread the message and get people to think, it's possible that 1-on-1 discussions convert more people per time-period (maybe leaflets are the best way to start such a conversation). Maybe the best way is to start with friends rather than strangers.<br/><br/>As I once pointed out on the forums, overly aggressive messages may be counter-productive (I was thinking PETA were a bunch of loons from the leaflet comparing nazi concentration camps to farm animals today; though I now see the point and actually rather agree that the comparison should not be offensive at least upon careful reflection, I still think their approach may have been a little worse than if they'd tone down the message). <br/><br/>I'm still thinking about these issues from time to time - I'm a little puzzled how seemingly good people (my friends who seem to be nice people otherwise) continue to eat meat when several other friends and I in our company (almost) never do - explicitly on ethical grounds. I'll keep pushing from time to time, I suspect getting friends to change may be easier than it is to change strangers.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">One of the main approaches I have when talking about veg*nism is to emphasize that there is a continuum between eating as much meat as humanly possible all the time and not eating any: by simply eating a little less meat even once a week, one already makes it so that less animals suffer. <br/><br/>I may be mistaken about my demeanor as I speak, but I think I come off (reflecting my true position) as fueled by caring  about the welfare of the animals, rather than by indignation or moral disgust over those who are still eating meat. Furthermore I emphasize how I too once ate meat at the beginning of college, and how initially I thought vegetarians to be pseudo-crazy, yet I began to see their point of view upon careful reflection and over time slid towards the veg*n edge of the continuum.<br/><br/>I don't know if this point hurts my case, but sometimes I share how it seems peculiar that so many (otherwise) good people continue to do something I am arguing is morally very problematic; to show how this is common I bring the analogy about holding slaves. At a certain time it would have been very easy to think holding slaves was morally unproblematic, and any one person who would choose to abstain from the action would lose out financially and would look ludicrous in the eyes of others.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">I think it's right that changing friends is easier than changing strangers. It's also more likely to be something you can do casually. Converting strangers will require dedicating a lot of time and resources, which you need to weigh against the other things you could be doing with it - one of which is earning money to pay people who're better at converting people to vegetarianism than you. Alan has found what he <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/dollar-worth.pdf">argues</a> is a pretty good cause, but IMO promoting animal welfare for its own sake isn't as good a prospect as it looks at first. I've lost the post where I argued this, but the gist is aside from its low impact on existential risk, it loses a lot of the viral benefit of promoting happiness elsewhere - where if you make a person happier, they're then better disposed and in a better position to pass the happiness on to others.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">There are some general statistics on what demographics are more likely to become veg*n. For example, 2/3 of vegetarians are female. Vegetarians had an average of 5 points IQ above average as kids (though it might not be a causal relationship). Sourced from <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism#Demographics">wikipedia</a>.<br/><br/>Anecdotally, gay men seem more likely to become vegetarian. I must stress this too is anecdotal: they also seem more likely to be interested in engaging with the topic and admitting that the suffering is bad, straight men <span style="font-style: italic">sometimes</span> seem more likely to believe that eating meat is a sign of <a class="postlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealMenEatMeat%20">masculinity</a><br/><br/>So those are the demographics you might want to concentrate on if you want to make more veg*n's.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I don't know about strategies for converting because I've never successfully done that.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Ditto. It seems worth keeping in mind that religious people who dedicate their lives to converting people in developed countries have a very low hit rate, and probably have a more appealing concept to promote. IMO the best bet might be buying a couple of copies of Peter Singer's Practical Ethics (a much more interesting read than Animal Welfare IMO, which I barely got through the first chapter of) to lend out to anyone who's interested in the subject.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">I think, prima facie, the approach of Vegan Outreach is pretty sound. Their leaflets appeal to the emotions with graphic evidence, then follow up with rational argument (no PETA-style theatrics). They put their front line on campuses and have them engage with the significant minority of students who care about animal welfare and are close to a tipping point to becoming vegans. <br/><br/>Contrarily, when I engage with friends about veg*nism, they are usually nowhere near that tipping point. Asking them to care about animal suffering is more or less futile because they have a deep seated belief animals are subhuman and outside our circle of moral consideration. The result has been many awkward social interactions, which have probably only entrenched their opinions that veg*ns are preachy. <br/><br/>While I think Vegan Outreach is doing a good workhorse job, I think there's still a lot of room for innovation in getting the message out. Fertile ground may be the tactics of online social movements like Avaaz or GetUp in Australia, or more recently the gay group All Out, which utilise social media to build awareness, spread memes and pressure governments into action (all are, to my knowledge, social justice based but still speciesist). I think there's probably room for a broad-based animal rights based online social movement along these lines. Veg*nism tends to attract young, savvy college students, but also those who are not necessarily committed to political action; I think messaging should reflect this. For example, online petitions, games, memes and so on. <br/><br/>PETA is good on innovating at messaging (though its effectiveness is, of course, open to question) and should not be disregarded. <br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>if you make a person happier, they're then better disposed and in a better position to pass the happiness on to others</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Hmm. But what about the impact on animals of raising the human standard of living? For example, China's increasing prosperity has been a disaster for factory farmed animals.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Hi yboris.<br/><br/>I have been a vegan activist for the last years. <br/><br/>You ask two hard --but interesting-- questions:<br/><br/><br/>1) What kind of individuals are more likely to become veg*n?<br/><br/>There can be a lot of surprises, but:<br/><br/>- Females are more likely to become vegan than males.<br/>- Young people are more likely to become vegan than old people.<br/>- Cultured people are more likely to become vegan than non-cultured people.<br/><br/><br/>2) What are some of the best approaches you know of making someone veg*n?<br/><br/>Documentaries like "Earthlings" are a very effective way of making someone vegan. But there is problem: most people don't want to watch to these documentaries.<br/><br/>There are several tools than can be combined: documentaries, leaflets, stalls, performances, professional websites, Facebook...<br/><br/>On the other hand, I think the most effective way isn't always to speak with the people. Activism is more effective when it's well organizated. Animal rights charities need designers, lawyers, journalists, writers, marketing advisors, economists, donors, translators and so on. If you are good in a task, you can offer your services to a charity for free, and you will be doing a lot for the animals.<br/><br/><br/>There are another topics you mention:<br/><br/>"One of the main approaches I have when talking about veg*nism is to emphasize that there is a continuum between eating as much meat as humanly possible all the time and not eating any: by simply eating a little less meat even once a week, one already makes it so that less animals suffer."<br/><br/>True, but I want to get animal advocates. Nearly all the most involved people in animal defense that I know are all vegans. I prefer one animal advocate than ten people eating less meat. So I think it's not a bad idea to push vegetarians into veganism.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>"As I once pointed out on the forums, overly aggressive messages may be counter-productive (I was thinking PETA were a bunch of loons from the leaflet comparing nazi concentration camps to farm animals today; though I now see the point and actually rather agree that the comparison should not be offensive at least upon careful reflection, I still think their approach may have been a little worse than if they'd tone down the message)."<br/><br/>IMO veganism isn't "the last step". It's important to make vegans, but it's even more important to make anti-speciesists. There is a lot of suffering in the wild, and it's a lot of more likely to reduce that suffering in a less-speciest world.<br/><br/>The campaign that you mention was a hardcore anti-speciesist one. It brought bad reactions, but it attacked the root causes of the problem.<br/><br/>I live in Spain, where anti-speciesism is found among a lot of animal advocates. And I can see that there are a lot of activists with a more-advanced position than most of American and British activists. There are a lot of Spanish animal advocates buying vegan pet food or defending ethical interventions in the wild, what is pretty strange among American and British animal advocates.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">David Pearce's approach worked very well with me (and would probably work better on the average person, who is more driven to action by emotion and less driven to action by rational argument than me):<br/>1. You conveniently let people know that you're vegan (e.g. "Thanks for the offer, but I'm a vegan")<br/>2. You bring up the topic with them in a gentle, non-preachy, not-too-pushy way ("Have you ever thought of becoming a vegetarian/vegan?" "Yeah well I've been one for a few years. Why? Well, you know, I just think it's really bad the way factory-farmed animals are treated.")<br/>3. Keep the conversation like this for a while, fairly light.<br/>4. Deliver a powerful, cutting, emotionally-loaded, and preferably original, line (at the right moment!) I'd been pushing Dave for some more substance/detail to his reasons until he eventually said quite solemnly something like, "It's the animal equivalent of the Holocaust."<br/><br/>And just to echo what other people have said: females, friends, students, videos, leaflets, are particularly good IMO</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">From my medical teaching, I've learnt that the best way to achieve a change is motivational interviewing. I doubt the ability of activists to persuade others' is studied very much. So maybe activists can learn from a much more closely scrutinised practise, the effort of a doctor to elicit a behaviour change in a patient. This set of skills comes naturally to a very lucky few people. Most of us mere mortals, who read about motivational interviewing would think 'yes, I do this', 'oh, I have seen that work in the clinic', 'yes, this could persuade me', 'oh, maybe i should try that'. I'll disclaim that although the typical examples in a medical text are abstaining from alcohol, drugs, and so forth, obviously that doesn't mean I'm trying to equate meat to an addictive drug. So here are some handy exerpts from the first couple of sections of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26025/">this page</a><br/><br/>Ambivalence: <span style="font-style: italic">If you interpret ambivalence as denial or resistance, friction between you and your client tends to occur.</span> Rather, you have to regard mixed feelings as natural.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Five principles:</span><br/><span style="font-style: italic">Express empathy through reflective listening.<br/>Develop discrepancy between clients' goals or values and their current behavior.<br/>Avoid argument and direct confrontation.<br/>Adjust to client resistance rather than opposing it directly.<br/>Support self-efficacy and optimism.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Empathy:</span><br/><span style="font-style: italic">Be accepting, nonjudgemental, supportive and knowledgeable. Listen rather than telling, make sincere compliments and gently persuade with an understanding that the decision to change is the client's, providing support through the change process. Reflect on what the client says e.g. "so you want to change, but you see significant obstacles"</span><br/><br/>Avoid:<br/>&gt; <span style="font-style: italic">Ordering or directing. <br/>&gt; Warning or threatening. <br/>&gt; Giving advice, making suggestions, or providing solutions prematurely or when unsolicited. The message recommends a course of action based on the clinician's knowledge and personal experience. These recommendations often begin with phrases such as, "What I would do is...."<br/>&gt; Persuading with logic, arguing, or lecturing. The underlying assumption of these messages is that the client has not reasoned through the problem adequately and needs help to do so.<br/>&gt; Moralizing, preaching, or telling clients their duty. These statements contain such words as "should" or "ought" to convey moral instructions.<br/>&gt; Judging, criticizing, disagreeing, or blaming. These messages imply that something is wrong with the client or with what the client has said. Even simple disagreement may be interpreted as critical.<br/>&gt; Agreeing, approving, or praising. Surprisingly, praise or approval also can be an obstacle if the message sanctions or implies agreement with whatever the client has said. Unsolicited approval can interrupt the communication process and can imply an uneven relationship between the speaker and the listener. Reflective listening does not require agreement.<br/>&gt; Shaming, ridiculing, labeling, or name-calling. <br/>Interpreting or analyzing. Clinicians are frequently and easily tempted to impose their own interpretations on a client's statement and to find some hidden, analytical meaning. Interpretive statements might imply that the clinician knows what the client's real problem is.<br/>&gt; Reassuring, sympathizing, or consoling. Clinicians often want to make the client feel better by offering consolation. Such reassurance can interrupt the flow of communication and interfere with careful listening.<br/>&gt; Questioning or probing. Clinicians often mistake questioning for good listening. Although the clinician may ask questions to learn more about the client, the underlying message is that the clinician might find the right answer to all the client's problems if enough questions are asked. In fact, intensive questioning can interfere with the spontaneous flow of communication and divert it in directions of interest to the clinician rather than the client.<br/>&gt; Withdrawing, distracting, humoring, or changing the subject. Although humor may represent an attempt to take the client's mind off emotional subjects or threatening problems, it also can be a distraction that diverts communication and implies that the client's statements are unimportant.</span><br/><br/>If you're interested in reading the detail of the next four principles, then follow the link.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Huge generalisation of course but there's some truth in it.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<h3><a href="#p3276">Change of Heart (book on activism)</a></h3>
<p class="author"><img alt="Post" height="9" src="../styles/nexus/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" title="Post" width="11"/>by <strong><a href="../user/388.html">Pat</a></strong> on 2011-07-12T00:26:00</p>
<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">I just finished reading <a class="postlink" href="http://www.thehumaneleague.com/changeofheart/index.htm"><span style="font-style: italic">Change of Heart: What Psychology Can Teach Us About Spreading Social Change</span></a>, which has a lot of relevant ideas. The author is Nick Cooney, the founder &amp; director of The Humane League. He doesn't have a lot of psychology credentials, so I'm not sure of his ability to critically assess the research (he relies a lot on pop-psych books such as <span style="font-style: italic">The Tipping Point, Influence, Made to Stick</span>). But there's no other book that I'm aware of that applies psychological-research findings to changing people's attitudes about animal welfare (animal welfare accounts for maybe 2/5 of his examples; he also mentions environmental, labor, gay rights, etc.).<br/><br/>I thought it would be useful to summarize the book. What I wrote is a bit long, but much shorter than the book itself. If you want any of his references, I'd be glad to send them to you. And please criticize anything you disagree with. I tried to put things in my own words, but there is probably some unintentional plagiarism. Antepenultimate caveat: These techniques are not magical. It might be better to try to influence many people in low-quality interactions (e.g., passing out leaflets [or earning money to donate to Vegan Outreach]) than a few high-quality interactions. Penultimate caveat: Who knows whether laboratory findings will hold up in the real world‽ Final caveat: I haven't tried most of these things out.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Empathy</span><br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022351402012086">Empathy avoidance</a> is the tendency to avoid empathy-inducing experiences that will cause you to act in a costly way. For example, you might cross the street to avoid a beggar instead of continuing on your way and rejecting his pleas. In animal advocacy, people try to avoid media that show animal suffering if they are aware that a costly change (i.e., vegetarianism or veganism) will be asked of them.<br/><br/>An experience I had with my sister illustrates this phenomenon. She watches those Animal Planet shows in which the animals are rescued from abusive owners (including <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_Boss_%28TV_series%29"><span style="font-style: italic">Pit Boss</span></a>, a show about midgets [!] who rescue pit bulls). She feels bad for the animals, but no behavioral change is demanded of her. But when I tried to give her one a Vegan Outreach pamphlet, she refused to even look at it, because she knew it would demand a costly behavioral change on her part.<br/><br/>We should strive to get people to feel empathy with animals, not just to feel bad.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Guilt/Blame</span><br/>It's not effective to blame people for the suffering caused by their diets. So don't say, "In the last year, you've been responsible for the death and suffering of thirty-five chickens, etc." Guilt isn't effective at persuasion; making strong moral accusations usually just leads people to defend themselves. Instead, direct blame toward factory farms and frame veganism in terms of helping animals, as in one of the Vegan Outreach pamphlets: "By avoiding the meat of chickens, turkeys, and pigs, you can prevent the suffering of more than two thousand of these animals during your lifetime!" (It might be better to use smaller numbers, e.g., one animal every ten days or whatever, because of <a class="postlink" href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/hw/scope_insensitivity/">scope insensitivity</a>.)<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Attitude-Behavior Gap</span><br/>Even though less than four percent of Americans are vegetarian, twenty-five percent say that animals deserve the same rights as humans. Most people find the conditions that factory-farmed animals are kept in abhorrent, but few change their behavior because of it. Oftentimes, it's not people's attitudes that need changing; it's their behavior.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Social Norms</span><br/>People tend to go along with the behaviors that are well established in their society. Few people are vegetarians, so don't draw attention to this fact. Instead, say that <a class="postlink" href="http://www.globalanimalpartnership.org/for-retailers/consumer-support-for-animal-welfare/">97% of Americans believe</a> that animals deserve (at least some) protection and that the number of vegetarians is increasing. Organizations like PETA seek <a class="postlink" href="http://www.petacatalog.com/products/Vegetarian_Celebrity_Leaflet-414-39.html">endorsements from celebrities</a> in part to make vegetarianism and animal rights seem more normal. The problem with this approach is that it gets people to do the right thing for the wrong reason; to spread concern for wild animals, it's better to get people to stop eating meat because they empathize with animals. But see <span style="font-weight: bold">Cognitive Dissonance</span> below.<br/><br/>If you're passing out leaflets and people are dropping them on the ground, pick them up: If people see that others have left them on the ground, they'll be more likely to do the same. And if several consecutive people have refused to take a leaflet, wait awhile; people are more likely to refuse if they've seen someone else do the same.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Cognitive Dissonance</span><br/>People usually see their behavior as consistent with their beliefs. (The reason that people care about animal welfare but still buy factory-farmed meat is probably that they just don't think about the issues, or they think about them in silly ways.) If you tell someone that eating meat is wrong, she'll probably think, "But I eat meat, and I'm a good person. So eating meat <span style="font-style: italic">can't</span> be wrong!" And then she'll raise some bogus objection that just occurred to her off the top of her head.<br/><br/>Cognitive-dissonance theory predicts that attitudinal change will often <span style="font-style: italic">follow</span> behavioral change. If you can get someone to go vegetarian for any reason, she will probably be more sympathetic to animal-welfare issues because anti-speciesist beliefs will not conflict with her behavior. Vegetarians of all stripes (save deep-ecologists and perhaps those intent on "<a class="postlink" href="http://www.all-creatures.org/cva/honoring.htm">honoring God's creation</a>") should be more open to the idea of preventing wild-animal suffering. (I think Alan Dawrst has had some experiences that conflict with this theory; I remember his writing that some of the non-vegetarians he's talked to have been <span style="font-style: italic">more</span> ready to acknowledge the badness of wild-animal suffering and our duty to prevent it than some vegetarians on online forums.) Nevertheless, it's better to focus on the arguments from animal welfare: Ethical arguments are more likely to produce lasting change than appeals to self-interest (i.e., health), and environmental arguments are likely to be counterproductive regarding concern for wild-animal suffering.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Costs/Benefits</span><br/>Don't tell people that vegetarianism is hard. People don't want to do things that are hard. Tell them that it requires virtually no effort after you've been at it a few months (that's my experience, anyway). Once somebody gets started, she'll (usually) realize that it's easier than she thought, so the first step is key.<br/><br/>Emphasize that concern for animal welfare isn't an all-or-nothing proposition. Eliminating poultry, eggs, and fish from one's diet is almost as good (maybe better in terms of tangible consequences, given wild-animal suffering) as going vegan.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Availability Bias</span><br/>I'm always surprised when people tell me how hard veganism is. Part of the reason non-vegans think veganism is hard is that they don't know what foods they would eat. They think, "Yesterday I ate a steak for dinner. If I took away the steak, what would be left? Vegans must eat only lettuce." That's why the Vegan Outreach pamphlets include information on animal-product substitutes and meal ideas. Mercy for Animals offers a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mercyforanimals.org/vegan-starter-kit.aspx">vegetarian starter kit</a> that includes several pages of recipes; <a class="postlink" href="http://www.chooseveg.com/vegan-recipes.asp">many more</a> are available online (I haven't tested any of them yet).<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Surprises</span><br/>If you want to get someone's attention, surprise her. When someone asks you why you're a vegetarian, tell her—then ask why she eats meat. One of Vegan Outreach's full-time leafleters says things like "That's a lovely smile you have" and "You look compassionate." That takes some serious <span style="font-style: italic">cojones</span>.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Monitoring/Feedback</span><br/>People are more likely to stick with a goal if they receive feedback about how they're doing. Cooney suggests using widgets that display the number of farmed animals that the user has spared owing to her dietary choices. Does something like this exist? I'm aware only of the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.abolitionistapproach.com/">slaughter tracker</a>, which is just depressing, on Gary Francione's website.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Gaps</span><br/>When people realize they don't know something, they become more interested. So you might ask someone to guess how much space a hen in a battery cage has, or what a gestation crate is, instead of just telling her.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Plans</span><br/>If you convince someone to go vegetarian, the battle is only half won—there are a lot of former vegetarians. If you've had a successful animal-welfare talk with someone, ask her if she intends to eat fewer animals and eggs in the future: Making a verbal commitment increases the chance that she'll follow through. (If you haven't been successful, don't ask; she'll probably say "no," and that will make it harder to change her attitude in the future.) Public commitments (telling friends) about a goal of becoming vegan can help. So can making concrete plans.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Foot-in-the-Door</span><br/>If someone consents to a small request, she'll be more likely to consent to a larger one later on. For example, if you get a friend to commit eating less poultry, she'll be more likely to be persuaded to go vegetarian later on. And from there, she's just a hop, skip, and a jump away from veganism, donating most of her income to Vegan Outreach, and becoming an evangelist for wild animals.<img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/> However, you must make a follow-up request for this technique to be successful; don't expect people to go further on their own.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Reciprocity</span><br/>People feel compelled to reciprocate (it has something to do with evolution). If you concede some side arguments, they'll be more likely to be persuaded of your main point. Giving ground on one or two issues will also make you seem more credible.<br/><br/>Reciprocity is also at work in the door-in-the-face method, which consists of following a demanding request that's almost certain to be turned down with a more moderate request. So you could ask a meat-eater to go vegan. When she refuses, ask her instead to reduce the amount of poultry she eats by half.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Credibility</span><br/>Making the same claim several times over the course of the conversation causes it to be perceived as more credible.<br/><br/>If your intent is seen as to inform rather than persuade, you'll be more persuasive. If you emphasize that you're trying to persuade somebody, she'll activate her cognitive defenses. So avoid saying things like, "I hope I'll persuade you to stop eating animals."<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Bearing</span><br/>Be nice. Be friendly. Look happy.<br/><br/>Look good. Comb your hair; pop your zits. (Attractive people are more persuasive.)<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Method of Inquiry</span><br/>Phrase things as questions.<br/><br/>Don't use systematic logical argument. Thinkers as diverse as David Hume, Jonathan Haidt, and Dale Carnegie have observed that people rarely change their attitudes because of argument. If somebody's views are contradictory, don't point that out directly; instead ask questions that lead her to question her beliefs (like Socrates!).<br/><br/>Emphasize areas in which you agree.<br/><br/>Don't—<span style="font-weight: bold">DON'T</span>—present your argument in a myths—facts format. After a few days, people tend to forget which was which. Just say what <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> the case. Instead of saying, "Lots of people believe that farm animals are kept in idyllic pastures, given individual names by the farmer, and sung to daily by beautiful shepherdesses, but this simply isn't the case," say, "Farmed animals are kept in execrable (EK-si-kruh-bul), despicable (<a class="postlink" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/despicable">DES-pik-uh-bul</a>), miserable (MIZ-ur-uh-bul) conditions."<br/><br/>Social Contagion <span style="font-weight: bold">IS WRONG WRONG WRONG</span><br/>The book contains a chapter on social contagion. The research, widely reported on in the media, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2298208/pagenum/all/">has been called into question</a>. We do have an influence on our friends and co-workers, but it isn't magical.<br/><br/>If we have a choice, though, it does make sense to try to influence people who are better connected.<br/><br/>P.S. Mercy for Animals has a good video called "Farm to Fridge" at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.meatvideo.com">http://www.meatvideo.com</a>.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

For one thing a chicken isn’t that big, so you only have to have a couple of sandwiches to amount to one whole chicken bought, if that’s the metric you’re using. For another, people eat a lot of sandwiches, so actually if you switch to being veggie for a year it seems very likely you *will* make a difference. There are hundreds of possible ways you could do so, from the grandiose – dissuade a farmer from extending his battery barn, allow a veggie friendly farmer to expand his farm and perform better relative to his competition, dissuade someone thinking about carrying on the family farming tradition from thinking that the income was worth the hours – to simply persuading one farmer to buy one less chicken when he’s estimating how many he’ll be able to sell.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

However, the distribution can have high variance, and most of the time, the actual number of chickens not raised may be 0.<br/><br/>Yeah, the difficulty of expressing this rhetorically comes when people feel less motivation for high-risk gambles than for certain gambles with the same expected value....</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Being kind, smiling, understanding are qualities that will make you more persuasive. And the book reminds us that if we are publicly overly strict with our diet we may discourage others from trying being vegan. The authors are even aware of the effective altruism concept - earning money and giving to charities can have a bigger impact than working for the charity yourself.<br/><br/>They also suggest that most people are more receptive to trying being vegan when you offer solutions to their dietary preferences. So don't tell them about some fancy new cuisine, tell them about the nearly indistinguishable veggie patties, veggie hot-dogs, etc. It makes their plate look more familiar = more likely to try = more likely to decrease meat consumption. <br/><br/>A thing we all know but may forget: becoming vegan is good, but converting a person to a vegan lifestyle instantly doubles our positive impact. This book shows you how to do this effectively.  <img alt=":D" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif"/></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="3"><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>LadyMorgana wrote:</cite>A: "Woah. Yeah. But that still won't make me a vegetarian because I don't think that my not eating that chicken sandwich will change anything."<br/>V: "Yeah it probably won't. But there's a small chance that it will. </div></blockquote><br/><br/>I think you can afford to be more explicit about this. For one thing a chicken isn’t that big, so you only have to have a couple of sandwiches to amount to one whole chicken bought, if that’s the metric you’re using. For another, people eat a lot of sandwiches, so actually if you switch to being veggie for a year it seems very likely you *will* make a difference. There are hundreds of possible ways you could do so, from the grandiose – dissuade a farmer from extending his battery barn, allow a veggie friendly farmer to expand his farm and perform better relative to his competition, dissuade someone thinking about carrying on the family farming tradition from thinking that the income was worth the hours – to simply persuading one farmer to buy one less chicken when he’s estimating how many he’ll be able to sell.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>As I understand it, there's a high probability that you will never change anything with a lifetime of veganism (although the expected value of chickens saved per chicken not eaten is still 1). A chicken farm contains about 50,000 chickens at a time (which means many more throughout a person's lifetime), and most people only eat about 2,000 chickens in their lifetime—so a decrease in supply by 2,000 won't be enough to justify shutting down a CAFO (unless you're lucky enough to hit a threshold).<br/><br/>Anyway, I think we should focus our arguments here not on "you actually do make a difference", because you probably don't, but instead on "the difference you make has a high expected value". But how do you do that? I've tried explaining how this works to a number of people, and they don't seem to get it**. Perhaps someone else has had more success? If so, how do you explain it to people?<br/><br/>** I think part of this is that they don't want to get it. Lots of people have no trouble understanding basic economic principles like supply and demand, but then when you explain them in the context of preventing animal suffering, suddenly all those principles are wrong and it actually doesn't make a difference.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
