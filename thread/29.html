<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">What traits do we share? Since we're hoping that this will be more of a general discussion forum for people sympathetic to utilitarianism than a forum for discussing utilitarianism, it'd be nice to find things we have in common. So here's my shameless effort to integrate us as we grow. While we're still just a handful of regular posters, it should be relatively easy. I can name a few things already:<br/><br/><br/>TraderJoe, Claceyj and me = fans of the card game bridge<br/><br/>TraderJoe &amp; BenHourigan = committed libertarians<br/><br/>Nick, Benthamite, Toby Ord (and Alan Dawrst?) = professional philosophers/ethicists<br/><br/>TraderJoe and Questionable Mark = recent maths grad; maths student<br/><br/>TraderJoe, Questionable Mark and me = all worn women's clothing on multiple occasions. Possibly for differing reasons  <img alt=":P" src="../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif"/> <br/><br/>Don Alhambra, RyanCarey and me = web comic addicts<br/><br/>Don Alhambra &amp; RyanCarey (ETA and claceyj, who's only a medical science grad in training to be a doctor. Doh... thanks, TJ) = both involved in medicine (I think - Don's a neuroscientist in something mediciney, IIRC)<br/><br/>Ryan Carey, Toby Ord, Nick, Ben Hourigan and me = live or have lived in Melbourne for a substiantial period<br/><br/>Toby Ord, Ryan Carey and me = fans of strategy games in general<br/><br/><br/>Did I miss any other obvious comparisons, or omit anyone from the above? Do they inspire any of you to burst into song (preferably duet)?<br/><br/>To finish, though I usually find hobby lists a bit dull, I'll have a go. Who knows what else we have in common? Mine:<br/><br/>Martial arts (zillions, though my favourites being kickboxing, Brazilian Jujitsu and anything purely flashy); strategy and role playing games, on computer or in person; writing/editing creative prose - though oddly not so keen on reading it unless it's interactive in some way - ie. I'm editing it or it's part of a game; Improv aka Theatresports; anime; anything that involves being on a boat, preferably on the sea; popular science (and very gradually trying to learn real science and maths); history of the major empires (though atm this mostly = a desire to read about them rather than any actual knowledge); some classic sci-fi (eg. Asimov's short stories, <span style="font-style: italic">The Forever War</span>, the first three <span style="font-style: italic">Ender </span>books, <span style="font-style: italic">Dune</span>, Star Trek: TNG, <span style="font-style: italic">Hitchhiker's Guide</span> 1-3, everything I've read so far by Stanislaw Lem); learning Japanese</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

In East Malvern :-p<br/><br/>While I don't share the scifi link, I do share your love of bridge. Well I did. I accompanied my dad to bridge club when I was about 6 years old. Apparently I was the youngest person who they had seen there. Unfortunately, I don't recall the rules, let alone the skill of it. I have only gone so far as returning to the game 500.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="font-weight: bold">Kotuku said:</span> Jack Johnson[/b]</div></blockquote> I enjoy Jack Johnson too! I appreciate a lot of popular guitar music of his style. Also, you've clearly travelled to each of the countries that I've been to. (All two of them!). Have you been overseas elsewhere?<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="font-weight: bold">Arepo said:</span>the Ender books</div></blockquote>. Yes! I enjoyed reading those books when I was growing up. I suppose I could think of many books I prefered to the Ender books except perhaps the writing of Diana Wynne Jones (e.g. Chrestomanci)</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">when we lived in melbourne we lived in sandringham and i really liked it a lot - but my husband ended up working really long hours, so for family reasons we returned to wellington - were there for 5 yrs (had prev lived there for 15 yrs) and have now been in chch for 5 yrs - it is slowly growing on me<br/><br/>i have lived in the US on 3 different occasions - as an exchange student, then when my husband was studying for his MBA at Columbia in NY city, with one baby, then after 6 yrs back in NZ, in Philadelphia for 4 yrs while he did his PhD, with 4 children. While we were there that time i took the 4 kids and drove from Philadelphia to Alaska and back camping all but 3 nights out of 3 1/2 months, while my husband stayed home and did the big part of his research for his PhD.<br/><br/>I have also visited England briefly several times, Ireland, Sweden, Denmark, France several times, Spain, Italy 3 times, Istanbul twice and a couple of short stop overs in Hong Kong and Tokyo. We never did the big OE straight after uni and have been playing catch up ever since!<br/><br/>None of my kids play bridge, but two of the boys play fierce 500 - killer instincts, testosterone toxicity, smart brains make them deadly to play against.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

But then that too seems to me to be a much more complicated issue, precisely as to what counts as pseudo-science. Maybe the issue is more one of a mindset than of precise theories. There are some people who have a certain “mystical” mindset that makes rational discussion difficult. The same goes for religion. If God was just a hypothesis, a physical entity the existence of which we could discuss, and agree or disagree upon, like we can agree or disagree upon any other particular factual statement, then it wouldn't bother me so much. The problem with religion is that it (generally) carries an implicit ethical <span style="font-style: italic">obligation</span> to believe in the existence of God, etc. That is what makes discussion difficult with religious people.<br/><br/>It's strange, actually. Why should not believing in the existence of X be seen as offensive to X?

I'm happy that women now have the right to vote.<br/><br/>I don't believe in rights as a fundamental ethical concept. However, I think ethics in practice has different levels. Something like the two levels of Hare, but I'd say there are more than two. It's like in physics: on the fundamental level, space is isotropic, which means that all directions have the same properties. So fundamentally there is no such thing as up and down. But now try to build a bridge with no reference to up and down...<br/><br/>I don't believe that animals <span style="font-style: italic">have</span> rights. I believe that they should be <span style="font-style: italic">given</span> rights. Just like before having the right to vote, women didn't have that right. In other words, there is no such thing as natural rights, or ethical rights, but that doesn't mean that we should do without the concept of rights in practice.<br/><br/>David</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

However they still retain "atom-speak" changing and improving the definition of atom - a reforming definition solution.<br/> <br/>When people use "free will-speak" they are in error if they think this refers to a contra-causal or libertarian free will.  Does this mean we should avoid using "free will-speak", well we can be a compatibilist and use this language appropriately without making this error. The implicit reforming definition approach is often used over "free will-speak" (see naturalism.org). <br/><br/>Here I agree with most of the posters that there are no such things are natural rights, that is "rights-speak" is in error when this is assumed or implied. However "rights-speak" is too useful not to use. (The success theory here uses  a reforming definition based on an argument that rights can be derived from welfare utilitarianism, which focuses only on "welfare interests" not any other interests we may or may not have, but this approach does not lead to absolute rights).</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I also recommend PKD fans to check out Stanisalw Lem. A very different style of sf but he also covers pkd's ever recurrent theme of the fuzziness between reality and fantasy. <br/>(Anyway IMHO the funniest ever sf story is Lems' "The Great Washing Machine Tragedy".)</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
