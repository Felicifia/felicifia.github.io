<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">just watched both the videos, thanks for the links Mike.  I myself am undecided on this issue.  I would love to hear your thoughts.  With my very feeble understanding of this topic, my guess would be that many of the posters here would be non-cognitive prescriptivists like Hare.  I did a cursory search through the Felicifia archive and it seems that <a class="postlink" href="http://felicifia.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=68">faithlessgod</a> would disagree with this foundation and describe himself as a cognitivist moral realist.  Sam Harris would probably agree with this view; he seems to hold something like ethical naturalism in his recent Ted talk.  I cannot gauge clearly where someone like Peter Singer stands on this one.  When criticized for being a non-cognitivist in "Peter Singer Under Fire", he claims to be "ambivalent about non-cognitivism" and says he is closer to an "objectivist" but still holds Hare's universal prescriptivism.  I would love someone to explain what he likely means by this.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Thanks for the post.  I read the Wiki link, but I don't have the bandwidth for the others.  I don't have any background in this area, but I need to explore meta-ethics to answer some questions about the nature of morality relative to the natural environment.  Painism does not address the well-being of plants or inanimate objects that have no usefulness to beings, so either there is another way to view it or we can just go around converting wild areas into strip mines (as we do now for slightly different reasons).<br/><br/>The description of "cognitivist" identifies some good philosophical questions.  My view (today) is that there is no irreducible, objectively determinable good unless you specify the end toward which it is good.  I think even statements like "Murder is bad" lack a truth function because people do not have an adequately *precise* received view of what "bad" is.  If I planned to murder Hitler, the definition of "bad" would have to be split or refined to judge the degree of its badness.  I guess this makes me a non-congnitivist.<br/><br/>For evolutionary reasons, I believe that emotion has been key in shaping the behavior that we now call moral, however our set of morals from emotion is a post-hoc characterization based on the particular circumstance of humans.  If we were a species of parasites, our view of what is good might be focused on maintaining the longevity of others (host organisms) during certain stages of our lives (like some breeding cycle or cold weather cycle).  I also suspect that from the emotional base of morality, humans might be able to extend morality into some generalizations or universals, but the validity of these might be questionable (this is the type of question that I would like to answer). I don't think any individual can use his or her emotions as a guide to what is "right," because sociopaths lack the emotional basis to evaluate their evil actions--which doesn't mean that "murder is right for sociopaths."  It seems that emotions must be a starting point and that we should strive to construct order from the sea of emotions that have helped humans advance this far.<br/><br/>I suspect that Hare's moral prescriptions are not mutually exclusive to other views, as long as you put a boundary on their application.  If person A says that murder is bad, of course that means that person A thinks that murder is wrong (at least in some situations), and in much of the Western world it would mean that the person is also thinking "Don't kill!"  There might be some argument about the command part: Buddhists seek acceptance of they way the world is and might refrain from thinking or commanding people in any way.  In some schools of Buddhism (I knew a monk in the Theravedan tradition), they don't say "Don't Kill!" but the precepts that they adopt say that "I will strive to refrain from murder."  Their precepts do not command them to go around giving any commands to others, but instead ask monks to accept that there are people who do bad things and just focus on their own release from suffering.<br/><br/>I think I am a centralist in that the idea of "just" is founded on simpler moral concepts.  I just saw a truck for the National Guard, and it had every higher-order term they could fit on it: duty, honor, selfless action, and a bunch more (all designed to trick people into doing something that moral people would avoid--i.e, enlisting to kill others on command and without justification).<br/><br/>I think I am closer to value pluralism than value monism, but if the difference between two moral values is great, then we can judge them on one scale.  Eating 0.001 grams of a cookie is not as good as eating a regular bowl of ice cream.  I am closer to moral universalism than to moral relativism, and I think there are many ways to draw bad inferences from these labels.  <br/><br/>Relativist/Universalist example: I think women should not be forced to cover their faces, but in some parts of the world, this is required.  I also think it is wrong for a foreign country to invade a country to allow women to uncover their faces. I guess I see the value as being close to universal, but I don't see the "value" of criminal punishment to be universal.  In other words, the disvalue of a man forcing a woman to cover her face in the U.S. is different than what it would be in some parts of Saudi Arabia. By comparison, women in the U.S. do not feel oppressed by being forced to wear shirts.  Their acceptance of this is largely socially constructed, but it is feasible that in the future they will see this tradition as oppressive.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">I DO agree with utilitarianism boiling down to mind-dependent subjective experiences, but I don't think that makes me an anti-realist. The ethical proposition "Happiness is intrinsically good" is about a robust fact about the world (about happiness, which is part of the world) and the truth of this fact is not affected by any person's subjective opinion. "Mind-independent" is a slightly misleading term - I think it's used to distinguish between things that are dependent on being observed or on someone's opinion, and things that aren't. The confusion arises because minds (and the things they contain/give rise to e.g. happiness) are part of the world too.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">I hope Lady Morgana's position isn't such a rare one. It seems perfectly sensible to me that utilitarian should boil down to experiences. The point is that the distinction between real objective facts and imagined subjective facts gets a bit tricky when it comes to experiences. Experiences are real. They arise from thoughts. The thoughts can be about fictional, or non-fictional events, but that doesn't change the fact that they're also real. But experiences and thoughts are subjective, in that they're personal to one person's mind. <br/><br/>I hope I'm making some sense there.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Thanks for the suggestion, LadyMorgana.<br/><br/>Cognitivism and naturalist realism are the metaethical views that I give highest credence to.<br/><br/>Cognitivism because of the Frege-Geach 'problem' - that we can do logic with moral propositions, and that in general they behave just like empirical propositions - we can be more or less certain in moral propositions, etc.  The non-cognitivist can't explain this. My belief in cognitivism has nothing to do with utilitarianism.<br/><br/>Given realism, I'm a naturalist because moral facts supervene on natural facts, and I don't see how X can supervene on Y without every token of X being identical to some token of Y.  So my naturalism is at least partially independent of utilitarianism as well (non-utilitarians also think that the moral supervenes on the natural).<br/><br/>I think that realism is supported by utilitarianism, however.  Hedonism allows there to be a plausible epistemological route to moral facts (or, at least, to facts about goodness): how do I know that pain is bad, and pleasure good?  Because I feel them to be so.    It also alleviates the 'queerness' of moral facts: moral facts supervene on facts about consciousness.  Consciousness is already in the domain of 'queer' properties - things which we really don't yet understand scientifically.  So we shouldn't be surprised that moral facts also seem queer.  <br/><br/>If utilitarianism is true, then morality also <span style="font-style: italic">looks </span> like something that we should be realist about.  It looks much more like science and much less like disgust (humour, art, etc): it is representable by a small number of precise, clear and simple equations (e.g. that goodness = the integral of happiness over time, etc).<br/><br/>I should also mention that I think that utilitarianism isn't a theory of morality, as such, but is more plausibly a theory about normativity in general.  I don't think there are any additional sources of normativity: epistemological, or prudential, or aesthetic.  This, I think, adds to the 'scientific'-seeming nature of ethics.

There may be, but it can't be proven.<br/><br/>Life works based on assumptions. In academic affairs there's more thought put into them, but there's still reliance on basic assumptions which we call axioms. Utilitarianism is the ethical theory that uses the least axioms while maintaining logical consistency.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I haven't found a more objective definition of 'good' than 'satisfactory' or 'preferable'. I believe 'to kill people is bad (not good)' is the same as 'it is preferable not to kill people' or 'it is more satisfactory to not kill people'. So it proceeds that I would follow an ethical theory based on satisfaction or preference.<br/><br/>I read someone (maybe in this forum) quoting Singer I think it was: If we can't find what it really means to be good beyond any reasonable doubt, at least what we can do is what we like best.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Will Crouch wrote:</cite>Cognitivism because of the Frege-Geach 'problem' - that we can do logic with moral propositions, and that in general they behave just like empirical propositions - we can be more or less certain in moral propositions, etc.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>If logic can be applied to anything else, why wouldn't it be applicable to moral statements? Exactly, any kind of certainty in regards to a moral proposition means that it is either true or false. Non-cognitivism consequently means moral agnosticism.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Ethics is just the science of normativity.</div></blockquote><br/>Unless we have a way of making tests of ethics, it isn't science. A hedometer won't cut it; who's to say happiness is good? A black box won't work; who knows what it measures? Our intuitions don't work; they fall under "black box".<br/><br/>I believe that there are good qualia and bad qualia. I don't know why they'd be divided that way any more than I know why they'd exist in the first place. As far as I can tell, I believe they exist because I'm self-aware, and I believe that there are good and bad ones as a consequence of being affected by classical conditioning. I mean that in the fallacy sense. Being self-aware doesn't make it true; it just makes me believe it is. Despite my believing that, I can't make myself not believe in qualia. I'm simply not capable of not believing in them. I can't not be self-aware. It's just how my brain works. Besides, I don't take nihilism well, and I don't want to go through that again.<br/><br/>For some odd reason, I have no trouble believing in the existence of qualia that aren't mine. It makes sense given that they exist and what I know, but it seems like something I wouldn't be able to believe. It's possible I only believe that I believe it.<br/><br/>Once I accept that others' qualia exist, and that some are more valuable than others, the implication is clear. I must maximize the good ones at all costs. There is no "weighing self-interest against morality". My qualia are just like the other qualia. If I focus on mine, I'm just getting distracted. I messed up. I don't think of it as being immoral, so much as being erroneous.<br/><br/>There's more too why I act the way I do. I don't seem to care much about anything, so I'm not giving anything up. When I think about what I'd do if I spent money, all I can think of is making cool stuff. I have a computer. I know how to program. I don't need to buy anything to make cool stuff. I also seem to have an inherent sense that there isn't supposed to be a separate self-interest and morality. When I believed that there was no morality, I cried about it until classical conditioning forced that I stopped believing that there was no morality. Some people might have just gone with self-interest.<br/><br/>Also, I read through a list of fallacies and paradoxes on Wikipedia. When I started, I balanced between logic and intuition. When I finished, I trusted logic completely. Logic told me Utilitarianism. It had told me that before, but only then did I trust it with everything.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">To say that ethics is science is the equivalent of saying art is vector graphics. An intersection of both is necessarily more restrictive than the whole, it is not fully representative of the matter. Granted that we can benefit from a more science driven ethics, but a positivist or analytical position is not the norm in philosophy nor ethics. From Socrates to Kant to J. Mill authors have contributed in very different ways to the discipline. <span style="font-style: italic">"I wish ethics to be more scientific"</span> is a very different argument to <span style="font-style: italic">"ethics is science"</span>.<br/><br/>In regards to the existence of morality, I believe it is a trivial matter. As defined by Wikipedia: <span style="font-style: italic">"Morality</span> (from the Latin moralities "manner, character, proper behavior") <span style="font-style: italic">is a sense of behavioral conduct that differentiates intentions, decisions, and actions between those that are good (or right) and bad (or wrong)"</span>.<br/><br/>The extend to which the distinction happens is very wide if by good/right we understand a preference for things to occur. For example, we can understand "it is preferable to not hurt oneself" as "it is good to not hurt oneself", and this with any other position that includes a preference for things to occur. You have preferences such as the one described, therefore you are moral, therefore morality exists.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">I'm happy to see that there are several moral realists here. I had the feeling that the overwelming majority of utilitarians were noncognitivists. I also thought Peter Singer was, following Hare.<br/><br/>I myself think that ethical propositions (prescriptions) are real in the sense that they have a truth value that is independent from my knowing that value. There would be no point in my wondering what is right and what is wrong, if I thought there was no right and wrong to be discovered.<br/><br/>I admit that I don't exactly know what this reality consists of, but I don't know that either for "factual" ("descriptive") propositions. What "really" is an electron, a photon, and so on? Is this object "really" red? Is it "really" true that the 12756th decimal of pi is whatever it is?<br/><br/>As far as I can tell, all arguments against ethical realism hold just as well against realism in general. There is no logical contradiction in holding that "there is nothing" (as an answer to "why is there something rather than nothing"), but the fact is that no one believes that. There is no logical contradiction in holding that "there are no prescriptions", but if that were so, we would really have no reason to do anything at all (nor not to do it); and no one believes that, since we do have to decide what to do (or to do nothing, which is something too).</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

We will not get any useful results through traditional analytic philosophical methods. I even think it is possible or likely that different groups of people and perhaps even the same people at different times mean different things with their moral terms.

We ought to be moral only insofar as our ideal self would wish for us to be moral. Perhaps it wouold be reasonable to call certain of our ideal preferences "moral preferences", such as for example preferences for maximization of global happiness. Because of this morality, in itself, is unimportant, it is only important to the extent it is important to our ideal selves. <br/><br/>In the light of this, the important thing would be to find out what our ideal preferences are, especially regarding "moral" matters.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1"><blockquote><div><cite>Jesper Östman wrote:</cite>There are no special moral facts in addition to basic physical facts and facts about consciousness. This means Error-theory is true for groups which have a cognitivist moral semantics.<br/><br/>Why are there no such facts? The reason is that we don't need to posit them to explain the only data we have - our experiences</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Suppose that there were no prescriptions. By that, I mean a total absence of reasons for you to do anything at all (including for you to act on your internal states, like thinking something over).<br/><br/>There might then be qualia - colors and so on, and maybe even pain and pleasure - but there would be no reason to do anything about them, even to avoid pain and obtain pleasure. In what sense would those qualia form <span style="font-style: italic">data</span>? We would have no reason to do anything about them, no reason even to register them and remember them. No reason to interpret the fleeting images as images of something, of a real world. The very notion of a real world would have no content, since we would have no reason to take its existence into account.<br/><br/>I think it is clear that if our qualia form experiences, data, reasons for believing in the existence of a real world, it can only be on the basis of our having reasons to act on that real world.<br/><br/>Such reasons for acting are, by their nature, prescriptions. If we do act, it's that we believe that those prescriptions are real; why should we act on the basis of something that is not real?<br/><br/>The fact is that no one really disbelieves in the existence of the real world. When Descartes famously decided to suspend his belief in reality, he recognized that such a suspension, if taken seriously, would make him "irresolute in [his] actions", that is would put him in an impossible situation. Thus he decided to suspend the suspension:<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>René Descartes wrote:</cite>so that I might not remain irresolute in my actions, while my reason compelled me to suspend my judgement, and that I might not be prevented from living thenceforward in the greatest possible felicity, I formed a provisory code of morals, composed of three or four maxims, with which I am desirous to make you acquainted.<br/><br/>The first was to obey the laws and customs of my country... (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/59/59-h/59-h.htm">A Discourse on Method</a>, part III)</div></blockquote><br/><br/>He could not decide to obey the laws and customs of his country without believing he had a country in the first place. In other words, the impossibility of living without prescriptions implied the impossibility of living without descriptions (<span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span>, without factual statements).<br/><br/>It is impossible to <span style="font-style: italic">really</span> disbelieve in the reality of the truth-value of descriptive propositions, and likewise it is impossible to <span style="font-style: italic">really</span> disbelieve in the reality of the truth-value of prescriptive propositions. On may <span style="font-style: italic">claim</span> to do so, but one may not really do so. Its not that when you claim to do so you are lying; its just that one does not necessarily know what one really believes. Descartes again, a bit further along:<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>René, again, wrote:</cite>it appeared to me that, in order to ascertain the real opinions of such, I ought rather to take cognizance of what they practised than of what they said, not only because, in the corruption of our manners, there are few disposed to speak exactly as they believe, but also because very many are not aware of what it is that they really believe</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I think that the fact that we, and probably all sentient beings, are by our very constitution incapable of not believing in the reality of the world and in the reality of prescriptions is the foundation of all our beliefs. Its not a <span style="font-style: italic">logical</span> foundation, in the sense that it is not something that proves those beliefs on the basis of a reasoning; rather, it is just that those are things <span style="font-style: italic">that we do, in fact, believe</span>, and there is no sense in attempting to do as if we did not believe them.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Selfish ("rational") prescriptions are no easier to explain, and to fit into a mechanistic physical world view, than are "moral" prescriptions. In our current mechanistic physical world view, only descriptions exist, not prescriptions. However, acting on a prescription of any kind implies believing in its reality, in other words in its having a truth-value; that goes for selfish prescriptions and for "moral" ones alike. The fact that the selfish ones are only "in our heads" doesn't change the problem.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Jesper Östman wrote:</cite>In fact, I'm a bit skeptical about facts about reasons for action also.

At the very least I tend to believe that if there are such facts they are reducible to experiential and/or physical facts.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I don't understand the error-theory part.<br/><br/>In my mind, the distinction between prudence and "morality" is much like the pre-Galilean one between the earthly and the supralunar realms. It was a well-established distinction, and one that, in a large part, worked. Things did appear to behave very differently down here and up there. Celestial bodies never changed, they didn't fall, they shined indefinitely (unlike earthly fires), and so on. But it later appeared that the distinction doesn't hold.<br/><br/>Despite tradition, there are some notable ethical views that don't make the distinction. One is utilitarianism. We are to maximize utility, whoever's utility it is. It would be difficult to see the command to make someone else happier as of a different nature than the command to make myself happier; both are included in the same way in the calculus of utility.<br/><br/>(Despite this, some utilitarians such as Hare and Peter Singer give an account of morality that separates it radically from self-interest. They start out from self-regarding preferences, which they take for granted, and then build morality through a universalisation process. At the end of the process, it would seem we have a double prescription concerning our interests: the original, non-moral one, and the moral one! I don't think that works out.)<br/><br/>Another view that includes prudential prescriptions in morality is the "egoistic" morality. See for instance the motto of the Ayn Rand folk: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=objectivism_essentials">"Ethics: Self-interest"</a>. I certainly don't agree with them, but that position does go to show that it is not completely contrary to tradition to include prudence in morality.<br/><br/>But the main reason I don't see any fundamental difference between self-interested prescriptions and moral ones is that even when I do something out of "self-interest" it is for the interest of my <span style="font-style: italic">future</span> self. The relation between my present self and my future self isn't much more direct and obvious than that between my present self and someone else's future self. The foundational difficulty of morality is said to be in the question: "Why should I care about someone else?". But one can also ask: "Why should I care about my future self?" Nothing now obliges me to take into account the future myself who, in perhaps ten years time, will suffer from cancer, if I do not now forfeit the pleasure of smoking this cigarette. So why should I care? The same is true even for a future myself that is only five minutes, or ten seconds, in the future. I'm not even sure that that self will exist! (I might be killed by a bomb five seconds from now.)<br/><br/>In this sense, there is no such thing as real self-regarding prescriptions. All prescriptions are other-regarding. The foundational difficulties of ethics are already there in the issues of prudence.<br/><br/>We don't usually include our self-regarding deliberations in the realm of ethics. That does not mean that they don't belong to that realm. We don't think of economics when we buy a loaf of bread, either; or of hydrodynamics when we drink a glass of water. Buying bread, and the movements of water in a glass when we pour it into our mouths, are nonetheless part of economics and hydrodynamics respectively. It would be quite artificial to define hydrodynamics as the science of the movements of fluids, <span style="font-style: italic">except</span> for those of water in a glass. Likewise, even if formal ethics are (often) not needed when we are thinking only of ourselves, such deliberations, and the prescriptions we attempt to gain from them, are ethical in nature.<br/><br/>This gives a much more unified view of ethics. Ethics is the science of the correct answer to the question "What is to be done?", whatever the terms of the deliberation. How ethics fits into the physical world is an open question, which is no easier to answer regarding prudential issues than regarding altruistic ones.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

In fact some people do. It's true that the natural tendency is to value happiness, because of the nature of the emotion as a self-reinforcer, but that doesn't in itself make it right, and provides only limited basis for altruism. So while I generally regard myself as a utilitarian, I also regard this as a choice rather than as a matter of truth.

It seems reasonable that morality will have the same structure; I see "morality" as being, loosely, a prescriptive set of rules that maximize some outcome.<br/><br/>Notice the parallel between statements in geometry and statements in morality: the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, but only for geometry on a non-curved surface. It is wrong to torture sentient beings (causing them great pain) for a little bit of fun, but only if we take the axiom that the sensation of pain instantiated in any sentient being is bad. <br/><br/>This approach does not attempt to solve the is-ought problem, it's appeals to common underlying axioms that people share. But when the axioms are accepted, there is no dancing around it - entailments of what is wrong are as solid as the ones in mathematics!<br/><br/>The work of an ethicist is then similar to that of mathematician: to carefully <span style="font-style: italic">discover</span> the truths of morality. Each statement will be a conditional statement, though there can be arguments about axioms on account of the consequences that they entail (as well as cost of implementing whatever moral rule into society).<br/><br/>I really welcome feedback on my position; I do not know if other philosophers have stated something like this and if there is a name for my position; nor do I know if it's tenable (perhaps I'm making some logical mistakes here).

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1"><blockquote><div><cite>RyanCarey wrote:</cite>The maths analogy is as good an analogy as I've heard for ethics. Still, I find it hard to beleive that it hasn't been thought before! (All good ideas have already been taken, it sometimes seems!)</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Er... I myself mentioned the analogy in my 2003 article <a class="postlink" href="http://www.cahiers-antispecistes.org/spip.php?article227">"Le subjectif est objectif"</a> ("The Subjective is Objective") - but I'd be surprised if I was the first to have come on the idea. I think it's usefulness is that it points out the possible difference between the concept of (objective) <span style="font-style: italic">truth</span> and that of (objective) <span style="font-style: italic">reality</span>. Many who deny that ethical statements have an objective truth-value point out that there is "no such thing" in the world as an act being bad, for instance; which is supposed to imply that the badness itself of the act has no objective existence. And if an ethical statement isn't about something real, something hard and concrete, made of wood and steel for instance, what can it be about? How can it be true or false?<br/><br/>However, there are clearly areas in which the true=real equation blurs. One is the past. What reality has the past? Where is it? Nowhere in the world! And if it has no reality, how can statements about it be true?<br/><br/>Furthermore, nowadays physics itself doesn't seem very convinced about the reality of the world. Matter seems to have dissolved... However, no matter how elusive the concept of reality (real, hard things) may be, I think we cannot do without a notion of truth.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>yboris wrote:</cite>I've been fond of an analogy I take between morality and mathematics:<br/>We can be more certain about truths in mathematics than of anything in the world (it seems), yet all mathematical statements are either axioms (accept or leave the conversation) or conditional statements (if P, then Q) -- unless you're a Platonist.

There have been many efforts to ground mathematics along these lines, as a simple play with symbols. That can give the impression that mathematics are about nothing. But in fact, mathematics are about something: basically, they are at least about numbers. Formal systems generally are attempts to represent arithmetic, that is numbers, including at least all natural numbers (0, 1, 2, 3...). The natural numbers appear here as something that is given, and that you can't just do away with. Choose whatever axioms you wish, seven will always be a prime number; if it isn't, then you're not really talking about seven. (Or about being prime.)<br/><br/>In that sense, I think that a certain degree of mathematical Platonism is warranted. Even if seven is not made of wood and steel, and is to be found nowhere in the world, it remains objectively true that it is a prime number.<br/><br/>And what about ethical statements? It's clear that we don't know how to ground them in reality (in wood and steel). When you say that <span style="font-style: italic">"The feeling of "morally wrong" we have when observing things is certainly a evolution-molded-hard-wired and culturally-learned-indoctrinated sensation"</span>, I think that is an empty sentence. Of course everything happens through evolution, because evolution just means things happening! The real problem is: if we believe that something is wrong, what are we believing?<br/><br/>I don't have an answer for that, but then I don't have an answer for what sentience is generally, nor for what the world really is made of. There are questions which I believe we can't answer today. To rush to conclusions like "since we can't quickly find an answer within our familiar framework of ideas, we must dismiss the problem" (<span style="font-style: italic">à la</span> Dennett) is just like the ancient astronomers who invented the Ptolemaic system, which <span style="font-style: italic">had</span> to be true since they couldn't conceive of anything better - instead of just admitting that they didn't know.<br/><br/>David</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Thanks David for the thoughtful response!<br/><br/>I posted what I wrote above on Facebook also and got spanked by my friends on several points: the "moral realism" I adore is more like "moral relativism": on the view I outlined, there in no claim about which axioms we ought to adopt and how one could even have disagreement about such issues. It's a shame the position I hold also seems to fall under the broad camp of "relativism" because it seems a far-cry from the numerous abhorrent versions of relativism.  <img alt="8-)" src="../images/smilies/icon_cool.gif"/> <br/><br/>I take some inspiration from Bishop &amp; Trout "Epistemology and the Psychology of Human Judgment" (an amazing read - I'd say a must for all philosophers). One of their claims is that empirical findings can have normative force; for example: given that you're a doctor and your goal is to minimize the number of deaths of the patients you treat, a finding that reasoning strategy X produces less deaths has normative implications on your behavior -- that is you <span style="font-style: italic">should</span> adopt reasoning strategy X. Here again you don't get normative force until you have some goal, but the goal here seems superbly uncontroversial. <br/><br/>David, I agree with most of what you wrote and some of your points are excellent! <br/><br/>Some thoughts I had (sorry when tangential) - have not thought all them through very much so do point out where you (anyone reading) disagree.<br/><br/>I like your point about time: though a presentist would share maybe your worry, one who holds a "growing block" theory of time, there would be no confusion about truth about past events.<br/><br/>It seems to me that  though questions like "What is the number of people in the room?" seem to have objective answers, they depend on definitions that are a rather arbitrary (even if very useful) ways to carve up the physical world (questions like these are plagued with Sorites paradoxes). <br/><br/>I am drawn towards Platonism too - the allure of 7 being a prime regardless of anything else is just too huge; though underlying such a conclusion is a certain kind of mental process that is instantiated in a brain evolved within a certain kind of medium: had we evolved in some weird version of a quantum world, where joining 2 things we'd get 1 and sometimes 3 (or some non-rational multiple), we'd have a hard time talking about 7 as prime. Though in a sense 7 would still be prime - it would only be so after accepting some carefully stated definitions of all the underlying rules; so it still feels to me like "7 is prime" is conditional on axioms that are in the end arbitrary. If you want to throw all such kinds of statements (along with their axioms) into the "Platonic Heaven", you'll end up with contradictory axioms there, or only conditional statements.<br/><br/>I'm a few pages into "The Moral Landscape" and so far it's excellent.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<h3><a href="#p2984">Re: Meta-ethics. What's your position?</a></h3>
<p class="author"><img alt="Post" height="9" src="../styles/nexus/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" title="Post" width="11"/>by <strong><a href="../user/797.html">Brent</a></strong> on 2011-06-11T15:09:00</p>
<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">I feel like there are a number of questions meta-ethical theories such as cognitivism, realism, emotivism, etc. are trying to answer: <br/>1.	Are there moral facts independent of our beliefs or feelings about them? <br/>2.	What do people mean when they make assertions about morality? This seems to be an empirical question which psychologists can answer.<br/>3.	What do I mean when I say that utilitarianism is my moral position?<br/><br/>As I will explain below, my answer to (1) is no, there are no moral facts independent of our beliefs or feelings about them. I think that (2) is an empirical question which psychologists can answer, but different people seem to mean different things when they make moral statements. some people mean to express propositions (cognitivism), some to express attitudes/values (quasi-realism), some to express commands (prescriptivism), and some to express emotional reactions (emotivism). Some who mean to express propositions are realists, and some relativists. Etc. Indeed multiple of these meanings could be present in a single person’s ethical statements, and probably usually are. But what people mean has no bearing on question 1 (whether moral facts exist), or on question 3, what I mean make moral statements, or in what sense utilitarianism is my moral system. On this question, I take a somewhat quasi-realist view about my moral statements, but I think that morality is more than about moral statements; it is also about moral motivations or beliefs. As described in , as a personal morality, utilitarianism is means that I value human/animal welfare, and this value is translated into a goal to maximize welfare.<br/><br/>I wrote a different post to explain <a class="postlink" href="../thread/406.html#p2983">my proposed meta-ethical view</a>, but here are my arguments against a number of meta-ethical positions from the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-ethics">wikipedia article</a> (most of which were argued for on this thread):<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Cognitivism</span>: Many people who make moral statements believe that in some sense that moral statements can be true or false. So cognitivism as an empirical theory of morality strikes me as at least partially true. Yet that doesn’t mean that *I* need they can believe moral statements can be true or false. I’ll argue against 3 forms of cognitivism: Naturalist realism, non-naturalist realism, and error theory.<br/><br/>In arguing against <span style="font-weight: bold">realism</span>, I’ll split it up into naturalism and non-naturalism. <span style="font-weight: bold">Naturalism </span>suggests that “there are objective moral facts and properties and these moral facts and properties are natural facts and properties” (<a class="postlink" href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism-moral/">source</a>). I think the problem with naturalism is show by Moore’s <a class="postlink" href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism-moral/#OpeQueArg">Open Question Argument</a>. My version of Moore’s the argument goes like this: Sure, you can say the definition of a “morally good action” is what promotes happiness, or that the definition of moral value is happiness. But that is just giving definitions. What possible implications can come of just defining terms? Or put otherwise: I understand that when you say “morally good action” you mean “action which maximizes happiness.” But why not just say “action which maximizes happiness”? How does adding the “morally good action” label change anything?<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Non-naturalism</span> seems to say that the concept of moral value is one which cannot be reduced to any other concept – it cannot ultimately be defined, we just know what it means or we don’t. I can see where this argument is going, but ultimately I don’t think there is any good reason to believe that such moral values really exist; at the very least, I don’t think I am someone who does “know what it means.”<br/><br/>Finally, <span style="font-weight: bold">error theory</span> claims that moral statements are meant as propositions, but are never true because moral statements can be neither true nor false. I accept that moral statements can be neither true nor false, but I reject the assumption that moral statements are always meant as propositions. Clearly some people mean them as propositions, but it is clearly also possible to mean them as attitudes, commands, expressions of emotions, or expressions of attitudes/values.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Emotivism</span>: Emotivism holds that moral statements are just emotional reactions to events or states of affairs. I feel that this view has two main weaknesses: First, caring about something doesn’t necessarily lead to action. One can feel empathy for suffering earthquake victims seen on the news, and even deeply hope that they receive relief, yet not decide to do anything about it. Second, emotions are not specific enough about goals. A feeling of compassion for others cannot tell us how to trade off the welfare of one person for another, for example. Emotions like compassion definitely contribute to my adoption of the goals of utilitarianism, but I think that the point of utilitarianism is to turn these desires to help people into a coherent and actionable set of goals.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Hi David, interesting ideas about realism. Here are some responses:<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I myself think that ethical propositions (prescriptions) are real in the sense that they have a truth value that is independent from my knowing that value... I admit that I don't exactly know what this reality consists of, but I don't know that either for "factual" ("descriptive") propositions. What "really" is an electron, a photon, and so on?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I don't know everything about electrons, but I know what it means to make a statement about an electron. According to Google, an electron is "A stable subatomic particle with a charge of negative electricity, found in all atoms and acting as the primary carrier of electricity in solids." That explains what we mean by electron, even though we still don't know the exact nature of electrons. We can replace this definition for the world "electron" in a sentence and understand what is going on. But what does it <span style="font-weight: bold">mean</span> to make a statement about moral facts? You don't have to know everything about what they are, but can you define what you mean?<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>There is no logical contradiction in holding that "there are no prescriptions", but if that were so, we would really have no reason to do anything at all (nor not to do it); and no one believes that, since we do have to decide what to do (or to do nothing, which is something too).</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I’m not sure what exactly you mean by “real” prescriptions or reasons, but I don’t see why we need to have belief in those types of things in order to act. First, a lot of times we act without any deliberation, which doesn’t involve conscious reasoning at all. Second, when we do act based on deliberation, it is because we have certain desires and we are deliberating about how to achieve or do what we desire. Once you have a desire, the question of how to achieve it is an empirical matter, in which there can be objectively right and wrong answers. But desires are entirely subjective – it would be meaningless to talk of a desire which exists independently of anyone having it. And universality doesn't apply – everyone has desires, but different people have different desires.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The real problem is: if we believe that something is wrong, what are we believing? I don't have an answer for that, but then I don't have an answer for what sentience is generally, nor for what the world really is made of. There are questions which I believe we can't answer today. To rush to conclusions like "since we can't quickly find an answer within our familiar framework of ideas, we must dismiss the problem" (à la Dennett) is just like the ancient astronomers who invented the Ptolemaic system, which had to be true since they couldn't conceive of anything better - instead of just admitting that they didn't know.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>The Ptolemaic system was an attempted answer to an empirical question - clearly more knowledge could be gained by science in the future. So is what the world is ultimately made of, and maybe what sentience is as well. But how could “If we believe that something is wrong, what are we believing?” be answered empirically? You can show what people are thinking, but if you are assuming there is some truth about morality which is true regardless of what people believe, do you think that is an empirically discoverable property? On what basis? How could anything that is discovered automatically imply that we value something?<br/><br/>Even though I don't know the underlying nature of sentience, I do know a lot about the phenomenon the word describes. But I don't know anything about the proposed phenomenon the idea "moral fact" describes. What reason do I have for believing in such a phenomenon?<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Choose whatever axioms you wish, seven will always be a prime number; if it isn't, then you're not really talking about seven. (Or about being prime.) In that sense, I think that a certain degree of mathematical Platonism is warranted. Even if seven is not made of wood and steel, and is to be found nowhere in the world, it remains objectively true that it is a prime number.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I think yboris' response to this idea was spot on, but I'll add an additional idea that I encountered recently: Mathematics is a system of abstraction which is useful to the extent its predictions come true, and not to the extent they don’t. If we had different axioms we would have a completely different system of abstraction. “7 is a prime number” only makes sense within the standard system of abstraction we use for arithmetic. If there were different axioms, it would be a different system of abstractions, and thus if I said “7 is not a prime number” about numbers in that system, I would automatically mean something different then what we usually mean, because I would not be talking about “7” or “prime” in our standard system.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2">Hi Brent. Thanks for your responses. Below is my answers to the first one only, because I <span style="font-style: italic">do</span> have to go to bed.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Brent wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>David wrote:</cite>I myself think that ethical propositions (prescriptions) are real in the sense that they have a truth value that is independent from my knowing that value... I admit that I don't exactly know what this reality consists of, but I don't know that either for "factual" ("descriptive") propositions. What "really" is an electron, a photon, and so on?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I don't know everything about electrons, but I know what it means to make a statement about an electron. According to Google, an electron is "A stable subatomic particle with a charge of negative electricity, found in all atoms and acting as the primary carrier of electricity in solids." That explains what we mean by electron, even though we still don't know the exact nature of electrons. We can replace this definition for the world "electron" in a sentence and understand what is going on. But what does it <span style="font-weight: bold">mean</span> to make a statement about moral facts? You don't have to know everything about what they are, but can you define what you mean?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>That Google definition gives a kind of "layperson's perspective" on electrons, using everyday words that point to familiar concepts. "Particle", for instance, evokes the idea of a kind of very small hard ball. That ball, of course, is supposed to be <span style="font-style: italic">somewhere</span> -- specifically, following that definition, in atoms... However, modern physics says that electrons are not <span style="font-style: italic">found</span> anywhere at all, since they cannot have a precise spatial position. They are spread over space in a strange way. Actually, they don't even have any individual identity, so you cannot say "this electron is here, that one is there"; the description quantum mechanics gives of their state implies that each electron must occupy the positions of all electrons. This may seem gibberish, but is definitely more correct than the definition you quote.<br/><br/>Electrons are not "found" in another sense: they are not hard balls that you might see and touch, giving you the familiar sense of having a grip on them. All you can actually do is measure the influence they have on their surroundings, for instance through the electromagnetic field they create. They seem to exist only through their influence on other particles. But then you have a problem of circularity, or of regression: if a particle exists only through its influence on other particles, and these in turn have no more existence than that, what can the word "exist" mean in the first place?<br/><br/>If you realize how abstract and "unreal" the modern physical description of the world around us is, the sense that when we talk about elementary particles, we "know what we mean" and "understand what is going on" quickly vanishes. The math describing them seems real. The fact that we can get a reading from our particle detectors, write and publish a paper on that basis and get a salary too seem real, but since our current physical worldview tells us that particle detectors, papers and salaries are themselves only just collections of particles, this concrete, down-to-earth reality itself seems to sit on a shaky basis.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the prescriptive fact that I should try to wrap this answer up quickly and get to bed, because I must get up early, seems to have a quite clear meaning.<br/><br/>So at least sometimes what it means for a prescriptive sentence to be true can appear to make more sense than for a descriptive one. Now I don't necessarily want to argue for some kind of "idealist" view according to which prescriptions, ethics, sensations and so on are the only real things, hard "reality" being an illusion. It's just that both sides of the coin -- the "descriptive" one and the "prescriptive" one -- appear to me equally problematic, and I think it's really unfair, and heavily biased, to accept outright the former as having a clear meaning while poo-pooing the latter as being just fairy that by their very nature can only be the effect of wishful thinking programmed by our genes.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div><blockquote class="uncited"><div>There is no logical contradiction in holding that "there are no prescriptions", but if that were so, we would really have no reason to do anything at all (nor not to do it); and no one believes that, since we do have to decide what to do (or to do nothing, which is something too).</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I’m not sure what exactly you mean by “real” prescriptions or reasons, but I don’t see why we need to have belief in those types of things in order to act.

But desires are entirely subjective – it would be meaningless to talk of a desire which exists independently of anyone having it. And universality doesn't apply – everyone has desires, but different people have different desires.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I don't think it's true at all that when we decide act it is only to fulfill our desires. In the morning I often have no desire at all to get up and go to work, yet I do it. Deliberation is not at all limited to finding the best way to satisfy our pre-determined aims; deliberation is often about the aims themselves. If there is something that I don't at all desire doing and that will bring me no pleasure doing, but that will bring pleasure and satisfaction to many other sentient beings if I do it, then my deliberations about whether I should do it or not are of an ethical nature. Their conclusion, be it one way or the other, will be an ethical conclusion, in other words is a prescriptive one, phrased as "I should / should not do it". I will act on that prescription, because I believe it true. I think that makes sense. If I did not believe it true, I would not act on it.<br/><br/>David</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<p class="author"><img alt="Post" height="9" src="../styles/nexus/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" title="Post" width="11"/>by <strong><a href="../user/797.html">Brent</a></strong> on 2011-06-18T03:01:00</p>
<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2">All right, here is my reply:<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>David wrote:</cite>Electrons seem to exist only through their influence on other particles. But then you have a problem of circularity, or of regression: if a particle exists only through its influence on other particles, and these in turn have no more existence than that, what can the word "exist" mean in the first place? …since our current physical worldview tells us that particle detectors, papers and salaries are themselves only just collections of particles, this concrete, down-to-earth reality itself seems to sit on a shaky basis.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>First, I didn’t realize that quantum physics said this sort of thing about all particles – I’ve mainly heard it about electrons. Does it say that really all particles only exist in their influence on other particles? If so, my current thought is that either this is contradictory, in which case it can’t be true, or it is just counterintuitive, in which case at the quantum level everything just exists in terms of how it influences other things, and this system of interactions makes up objects at the Newtonian level, which can exist whether or not they influence other things.<br/><br/>Regardless, I see your point that the concept of an electron is unclear. Maybe you could say that electrons are scientists’ current theory for what is causing a number of specific results we see in the real world? And maybe the cause of such results is something physical, maybe it is something which only exists through its influence on other particles. So when we talk about whether electrons exist, we are asking whether various different theories of electrons are correct. These theories may say they are particles, or maybe something else, but they are all theories which are ultimately about results seen in the laboratory and the wider world, and they all have claims which can be true or false (at least, all the coherent theories do). <br/><br/>But I don’t know what it would mean for a claim about moral facts to be true or false. Not only am I ignorant about what kind of thing moral facts might be; I don’t even know what the term “moral fact” might mean. Does “moral fact” mean a value which everyone has a motivation to have? Does it mean a value which helps us get along with others? Does it mean a norm which most societies have for their members to follow?<br/><br/>Finally, another thing about electrons is that we know how to learn things about their properties, even if we don’t know exactly what kinds of things they are. Scientists can conduct experiments to learn more about the behavior, if not the nature, of electrons. I'm not sure I understand what "moral facts" are enough to figure out how to know anything about them. How would you determine what is in fact moral?<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>David wrote:</cite>On the other hand, the prescriptive fact that I should try to wrap this answer up quickly and get to bed, because I must get up early, seems to have a quite clear meaning.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I understand the prescriptive statement that you shouldn’t stay up late, but I don’t understand what a “prescriptive fact” is. That you "should" go to bed seems to mean that if you decide stay up late tonight you will not like the result of that decision: being tired in the morning. Even if you didn’t care about being tired in the morning, maybe you would care about being able to think clearly in the morning, being healthy, or having enough energy to play soccer, or being happy; all of these desires would be undermined by not getting enough sleep. But if you didn’t care about any of these things, it wouldn’t make sense to me for you to say “I shouldn’t stay up late.” So I don’t think the idea of a prescriptive fact is required to make sense of your sentence.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>David wrote:</cite>Now I don't necessarily want to argue for some kind of "idealist" view according to which prescriptions, ethics, sensations and so on are the only real things, hard "reality" being an illusion. It's just that both sides of the coin -- the "descriptive" one and the "prescriptive" one -- appear to me equally problematic, and I think it's really unfair, and heavily biased, to accept outright the former as having a clear meaning while poo-pooing the latter as being just fairy that by their very nature can only be the effect of wishful thinking programmed by our genes.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I don't think that sensations, emotions, attitudes etc. are less real than physical things. If anything, they are more real - they are the only things we have direct access to. I'm not coming from Daniel Dennett-like perspective here. I'm coming from a Humean perspective – I don't think there is any way around the fact-value dichotomy.<br/><br/>Here is one way to think about it: Suppose it turns out that there are "moral facts", whatever those things would be. Why should I care? I presume those moral facts would form sort of moral code about how I should live my life. Yet why should I decide to live my life that way? For example, people might believe that God exists and commands us to live a certain way, but they still have to decide whether or not to follow God.<br/><br/><a class="postlink" href="../thread/406.html">My utilitarianism</a> can be divided into 3 things: a goal which I try to achieve, a replacement for parts of the "folk" morality I had before utilitarianism, and a guide for what I should argue is "moral" with other people. If at some point we discovered "moral facts", I might not decide to pursue the goals they stated, to put them into the pre-existing schema for morality which I already have, or to claim that those "moral facts" told us what is morality right. In what sense would I be wrong?<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>David wrote:</cite> There is no logical contradiction in holding that "there are no prescriptions", but if that were so, we would really have no reason to do anything at all (nor not to do it); and no one believes that, since we do have to decide what to do (or to do nothing, which is something too)...<br/><br/>I don't think it's true at all that when we decide act it is only to fulfill our desires. In the morning I often have no desire at all to get up and go to work, yet I do it. Deliberation is not at all limited to finding the best way to satisfy our pre-determined aims; deliberation is often about the aims themselves.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>OK, but do you admit that we often have a reason to do something without believing that the reason was true or false? That is, we believe it is true that our action will achieve our aims, but we don't believe that our aims are true or false? For example, say I am trying to decide whether to buy a car, and I want to do what my father would do in this situation. I decide that he would buy the car, so I have a reason to buy the car. If I didn’t want to do what my father would do in this situation, I wouldn’t have a reason to buy the car. Therefore my reason is contingent on my desire to act as my father would.<br/><br/>If you go to work even though you have no desire to, there are two explanations which are consistent with my view. First, you are not thinking about it, it is just habit. Second, you try to decide whether to go to work, and while you have a desire to stay home, you also have a desire to keep your job (or make money, or finish your project, or do your duty), and this second desire wins out.<br/><br/>I do admit that it is possible that people could act without having any desire to act – whether or not we do or not is a question for psychology. But we still have to be motivated to act – that is, there must be something which causes us to act, even if it is not a desire. And a belief cannot motivate in itself. Suppose you have the thought “X is a moral fact.” If that though causes you to act in accordance with X, there must be something in your brain which inclines you to follow rules which you think are moral facts. That is, you must have a motivation to follow such rules. If you don’t have such a motivation, then the thought “X is a moral fact” is not going to make you act.<br/><br/>So you might not consciously desire to follow rules you believe to be moral facts. But your acting on a moral belief is still contingent on some motivation to do so. You could easily not have that motivation. True, most people probably wouldn’t believe something was a moral fact if they have absolutely no motivation to act on the basis of this belief. But that actually supports my point that motivation is an essential element in action.<br/><br/>This argument holds for deliberation about aims as well. Deliberation about aims might be based on desires. For example, I want to help other people, and I want to follow a code of ethics which is logically consistent. If I deliberate about what I should do with these desires in mind, I might arrive at utilitarianism. This is an example of desires forming the motivation for my moral aim.<br/><br/>Now suppose desires do not enter into my deliberation. I posit certain principles a moral code might conform to, such as care for others and logical consistency. I decide that utilitarianism best meets these principles. But what motivates me to adopt utilitarian goals as my aim? If I am not motivated to follow a code which conforms to the principles of caring and logical consistency, then my deliberation was for nothing.<br/><br/>Finally, I don’t think you can decide to act for a <span style="font-weight: bold">reason </span>if you have no motivating desire or aim. Your goal might just be to act bravely, but if you have no aim you can’t have a reason to do anything. Can you come up with an example of someone having a reason to do something without presupposing a goal or desire which he is trying to achieve (for example, he is trying to make money, therefore he sells the car), or simply a thing which he is trying to do (for example, he is trying to do what his father would have done in this situation, after deliberation he decides his father would sell the car, and therefore he sells the car)?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="3"><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>but why should one maximize value/good?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Better is better, good is just good, we want better. Why do we want better? For the same reason we want good. 'Good' is an adjective we use for that which is morally preferable in contrast to something which isn't. With 'better' we make the same distinction, but instead of between a thing that is morally preferable and a thing that isn't, between two things that are morally preferable but one is more. <span style="font-weight: bold">x</span> is either good or better when <span style="font-weight: bold">Vx</span> &gt; <span style="font-weight: bold">Vy</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">V</span> stands for value. Maximum good is better, more good, than non-maximum good. So we want maximum good.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>one needs to be altruistic to say one should do this. I dont have any logical reason to be altruistic</div></blockquote><br/><br/>If we have firstly established 'satisfaction' is all that matters morally, choosing to morally favour someone rather than someone else is an ad hominem informal fallacy (is 'illogical') if not chosen for how much satisfaction they generate. Utilitarianism isn't altruistic for the sake of altruism. My well-being is not less intrinsically valuable than yours. We should give more moral importance to the others rather than to ourselves because there are a lot more others than there are ourselves, the others generate more satisfaction than me or you by mere strength in numbers.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
