<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Please give comments on this dialogue  <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/> <br/><br/><br/>A. Did you see that new documentary? What is it––The Human Conquests? <br/>B. That’s it, I think.<br/>A. Isn’t it amazing? I love humans. They are so cute. <br/>C. Yes, it’s wonderful how they’re so similar to us! And they’re just getting more and more––it feels like it was only yesterday that they invented the printing press!<br/>D. Oh, yes! I have eight or nine of them in my home.<br/>A. I especially love Nazis. <br/>D. Oh, those are the most adorable. Their swastika armbands, their goose-stepping––<br/>A. Adorable.<br/>D. Just right.<br/>A. But that documentary––<br/>B. The new one.<br/>A. Isn’t it wonderful, how they fight out those little wars? I was at the edge of my seat watching that Mongol footage! <br/>D. Why, yes indeed. They are just like us. Aren’t they?<br/>A. Remarkable what they do. Really is.<br/>C. And the scenery they create! Beautiful. You know, I was walking around in Auschwitz the other night, and I just had to stop and admire the crematoria. <br/>A. I love going for hikes in the gulag.<br/>B. I haven’t seen it.<br/>A. The gulag?<br/>B. The documentary.<br/>A. You have to see it. It is just adorable. <br/>D. The little dears can be territorial, can’t they! I bought the souls of an SS officer and a Jewish girl at the store the other day and put them in the same litterbox. My, what a silly mistake! <br/>B. Back when I delivered the paper, I would pass these neighborhood kids that would ask me for Catholic and Protestant souls, so they could put ‘em in the same jar and watch ‘em kill each other.<br/>D. How dreadful. <br/>A. I know. I’m a human lover myself.<br/>D. I really can’t abide it.<br/>E. What are you talking about?<br/>A. We’re talking about the new documentary.<br/>E. Echidna?<br/>A. The human one. Aren’t you interested?<br/>E. Not really. Humans honestly disgust me.<br/>D. Why? Why would you hate the cute little dears?<br/>E. Well––you know, I took a walk a while ago. Around Earth, right? So I saw the most horrible thing. Emaciated humans. Skeletons, really. Bent over with agony, in the freezing cold, starving. <br/>A. Was this Auschwitz?<br/>E. Yes, I think. <br/>A. Oh, isn’t it beautiful, though? You’re too squeamish. Aren’t the crematoria pretty? Don’t you like the smell of chlorine gas? And what about those pretty lampshades?<br/>E. Well, I suppose so…I don’t know. I just wonder if maybe we can’t intervene. Stop the Nazis.<br/>[shocked silence]<br/>D. But why would we do a thing like that?<br/>A. What, are you crazy? It’s natural. That’s just what they do.<br/>B. Yeah. You’ve been spending too much time with the Goddess of Mercy.<br/>C. There’s nothing wrong with it! They don’t judge us, do they?<br/>A. Exactly! We don’t have any right to say, “Oh, you’re doing such and such wrong.” It’s just not our business. <br/>E. You’ve seen the Nazis, though. What they do.<br/>A. Oh, get over it. It’s natural. It’s what the Father intended.<br/>E. It’s terrible.<br/>A. It’s natural!<br/>E. The Father made us destroy one another, didn’t He? Torture and kill one another? Those wars––we fought with the Frost Giants for millennia. They even killed Loki. The will of the Father simply isn’t always a good thing––<br/>A. Blasphemy. Absolutely sickening.<br/>C. How dare you compare something harmless like Auschwitz to the death of a god? One of your own! <br/>D. Oh, oh, this is too much.<br/>E. Why––<br/>D. Too much.<br/>E. Why––<br/>D. Too much.<br/>E. With respect, it’s only one god. They’ve killed a million humans in Auschwitz already.<br/>A. So what do you want, then? You want to contradict the Father? Why––why don’t you––why don’t you just––If only you were Loki! If only––! You don’t understand––!<br/>B. You want to exterminate the Nazis? Huh? What about my Nazi pets? You want to kill them too? Huh?<br/>D. Oh––how can you hate them! They have the prettiest coats––the most darling mustaches––<br/>E. A million. The Father says eleven million eventually. I asked Him. Murdered. Tortured, starved, asphyxiated. It’s natural––it’s––it’s His will, maybe, but we always change His will. We changed His will by building the cloud-cities. Why––why––we have the power to change it.<br/>A. No, of course we don’t, idiot. I’m getting sick of you. Opens a can of worms. You stop the Nazis from killing Jews, you know what could happen? The world is just so complicated.<br/>C. And how can you tell that they’re really in pain? You’re just imposing the standard of a god on other beings. You have no right. For all you know, the Jews in Auschwitz might be the happiest creatures the Father ever made.<br/>E. But––they’re in our image. We would be in terrible pain in that situation. They’re like us––just dumber and smaller, really. Their brains work like ours. <br/>A. You’re too damn sentimental. This is––it’s natural. It’s good. You can’t intervene. We can’t intervene.<br/>C. How disrespectful. How disrespectful to Loki. To compare human deaths––no matter how many––to the death of a god!<br/>E. Look, I––I’m just saying––shouldn’t we intervene? Didn’t––we’re the––the Father made us acres tall, gave us wisdom, fire, ambrosia––we should use the power. To intervene.<br/>A. They’re doing just fine without us.<br/>D. Look. Sometimes––sometimes I think someone should go put those poor Jews out of their misery myself––<br/>A. Blasphemy!<br/>D.––but how can you want to kill Nazis?<br/>A. Even you, D? Even you are this soft-hearted?<br/>E. I’m not sure––<br/>A. The fact of the matter is, this isn’t some kind of––interesting––philosophical––whatever. This is cheap, what you’re saying, cheap. Cheap, phony, soft-hearted pessimism. Stop Auschwitz? Kill Nazis? Ludicrous. Ludicrous. You know, any fool can whine about how bad the world is, but it takes a real man to understand the true complexities of the situation––is Auschwitz bad or good? Neither! It just isn’t our problem. Not our responsibility. You can’t impose your standards on humans. Like I said. How do you know that the Jews in Auschwitz are so unhappy? Humans evolved to murder one another. It’s what they’ve been doing for thousands of years. You can’t stop them! It’s against their nature.<br/>E. No¬¬, we can’t stop them now. You’re right. We’re not smart enough now. Someday we’ll be. We’re gods. We can make ourselves smarter––<br/>A. Oh, you’re a racist now too? A eugenicist? Pathetic.<br/>E. I’m not sure––<br/>A. Put a stop to this nutcase.<br/>B. Exile him.<br/>E.
