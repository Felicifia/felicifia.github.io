<h3><a href="#p5622">Why people give to developing-world charities</a></h3>
<p class="author"><img alt="Post" height="9" src="../styles/nexus/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" title="Post" width="11"/>by <strong><a href="../user/388.html">Pat</a></strong> on 2012-06-15T20:01:00</p>
<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="4">A lot of people in the effective-altruism and utilitarian communities give to developing-world charities. GWWC requires that donations be given to charities that benefit people in the developing world for them to count toward the pledge. Most of the donations made by 80k members <a class="postlink" href="http://80000hours.org/donations">go to developing-world charities</a>. Peter Singer promotes giving to developing-world charities. GiveWell focuses on developing-world health, though its focus is expanding with GiveWell Labs.<br/><br/>So I'm wondering why so many smart, compassionate people favor developing-world charities. They seem like a good bet if you're not aware of more-marginal causes, but they don't make a whole lot of sense to me otherwise. There are far more animals than humans, and there will be far more future humans/post-humans/animals than there are current humans. I'm wondering whether I'm missing something. Here are the explanations I came up with.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Evaluation</span>. Some developing-world charities have been vetted, and some outstanding ones have been identified by GiveWell and GWWC. Animal charities haven't been evaluated nearly as thoroughly. Existential-risk charities seem even worse in this respect, and they're inherently hard to evaluate.<br/><br/>If this is the problem, it seems that people should just fund evaluation of the under-evaluated charities, since the value of information is so great. If this isn't practical right now, they could wait.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Popularity</span>. Developing-world health is a more popular cause than animal welfare or existential risk. If many people believe something, it's probably for a reason—maybe even a good one. Better to follow the conventional wisdom now, and change our minds later when we have more information.<br/><br/>Popularity might be a useful heuristic, but there ultimately has to be a rationale. Otherwise, this is just circular reasoning.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Uncertainty about the future</span>. People might resist giving to organizations such as the SIAI because of the uncertainty about its effects. It could be making things better, it could be making things worse, or it could simply be irrelevant.<br/><br/>But giving to developing-world health has exactly the same problem. The vast majority of the value of such giving is concentrated in the far future. Will giving to developing-world health increase or decrease existential risk? It's not clear, but this factor dominates the expected-value calculation.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Public image</span>. It's easier to get people to give to developing-world health than to animal welfare or existential-risk reduction. So maybe we should promote what's more palatable, and focus on more-marginal causes later.<br/><br/>There's something to this. Maybe it's better to try to get prospective do-gooders to start giving to mainstream charities. But it still seems that we should focus our own money on whatever causes are most effective. It might be the case that my picture of which organizations like-minded people give to is distorted for this reason (i.e., people are trying to seem more mainstream)<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Other (less-good) explanations</span>. Animals aren't sentient, or if they are, they don't matter. Future generations don't matter, or we can apply a discount rate to their welfare. Third-world charities produce tangible benefits, while existential-risk and animal-welfare charities have effects that are delayed or indirect. Bill Gates and Warren Buffett fund developing-world health. Developing-world health is a "sure" bet.<br/><br/>Are there other (good) reasons, or did I not do justice to some of the ones I listed?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

This is a problem. I try to find the most rational utilitarian answer to these trade-offs, but I frequently suffer from cognitive overload due to the complexities.<br/><br/>It would be easy if you had a maximally efficient charity that says, "You can buy X hedons in the universe for $Y", but of course there's no such thing.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="4">Short version of humans vs animals for me:<br/><br/>a.	Helping humans provides benefits that compound over time for a very long time.<br/>b.	These benefits greatly exceed any downstream costs of having humans be more prosperous.<br/>c.	Helping animals may have benefits that compound for a little while, but not plausibly for nearly as long.<br/>d.	The long-term compounding benefits of helping humans put a huge multiplier on the value of helping humans.<br/>e.	Because of this multiplier, helping humans beats helping animals.<br/><br/>On the poor vs. meat-eater issue, I expect that factory farming will end on a short enough time scale (in super long terms), to offset damages. (I also generally have much less sympathy for animals than humans, especially animals like insects, and I don't think this is entirely due to any factual mistake, so I stand by this to a considerable extent.) I also believe that helping humans is a useful way of speeding up the destruction of nature, so if you're worried about wild animal suffering, you should seriously consider helping of humans as a tool.<br/><br/>Given this view, human helping should be optimized for long run growth. I accept this and I eagerly await GiveWell's investigation of meta-research as a promising cause in this category. In the mean time, I think helping insecticide treated nets and deworming are an extremely cheap way of buying human empowerment, which produces growth.<br/><br/>I think if you want to make an argument that helping animals is better than helping humans, you have to appeal to very speculative futuristic considerations, such as permanently altering some large share of humanity's values. I think it would be a big mistake to point to Alan Dawrst's write-up about what donations to Vegan Outreach can do for animals and think that the case in favor of helping animals over humans is closed.<br/><br/>I'm uncertain about direct x-risk reduction vs. ordinary helping of humans. It's important to remember that ordinary human helping may be x-risk positive because it may reduce the amount of time that humans spend in an unusually high x-risk period of their existence (there are opposing considerations though).  Also, though Nick Bostrom makes it sound obvious that x-risk reduction beats general promotion of growth in his Astronomical Waste paper, I think the point is not obvious.  If you look at controllable events from human history that sped up growth and controllable events in human history that reduced x-risk directly, it is a real toss up to say which did better on the long term scale.<br/><br/>All things considered, I lean in favor of x-risk reduction and think donations to 80,000 Hours is the best bet (disclaimer: I'm affiliated with CEA).</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="4">"Helping humans provides benefits that compound over time"<br/><br/>Human population size and quality of life has been on a firm upward trajectory of exponential growth since the industrial revolution.  If someone had done something like "save one life" or "have a child" at the time of the industrial revolution, the benefits (and harms) of this would have compounded exponentially over that time period, putting a huge multiplier on the value of the action.  This is a standard economic justification for using a discount rate. The mechanism is basically just one person being more empowered and then making beneficial trades, increasing specialization, and then there are diffuse benefits eventually distributed over almost the whole population. Nothing comparable is true about helping animals unless your ultimate justification for helping animals has to do with indirect benefits to humans.<br/><br/>Exponential growth will eventually end (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/09/limits-to-growth.html">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/09/l ... rowth.html</a>), but there is still a lot of room above us.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

But I think this kind of argument fails. Even very skeptical folks like Bill Easterly think that deworming and net distribution do a lot of good. And there is some RCT evidence that deworming increases future earnings of schoolchildren by a substantial amount (see Baird et. al. 2011, "Worms at Work" is the title I think). The intuitive argument is just that healthier people can more effectively participate in local economies, which produces economic growth.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>* Promoting open borders and free trade is a more focused way of promoting economic growth.

I don't think it substantially changes the argument.<br/><br/>x-risk reduction vs. growth promotion is a difficult issue which I haven't seen discussed at the level of rigor I'd like to warrant a confident the level of confidence that I see many pro-x-risk people as having. This depends a lot on how hard it is to reduce x-risk. If you think your favorite charity can reduce x-risk by 1/1000, then you probably should focus on x-risk reduction. I guess I side with the x-risk reduction folks, but I sometimes worry that I put too high of probability on longshots because I have a hard time distinguishing fuzzy things that should be 10^-6 from fuzzy things that should be 10^-3, or some such.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="4">(Coming late to this thread.)<br/><br/>Excellent post, Pat! I think you hit most of the main reasons why people give to developing-world charities, and I agree with your critique of those reasons.<br/><br/>And thanks to everyone else for the dicussion. While I don't agree with everyone's conclusions, each one of you made excellent arguments. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/><br/><br/>Hedonic Treader, any ideas where you would give if you were forced to do so now? At least, what category?<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Hedonic Treader wrote:</cite>I have not found a way to be really productive without being miserable, or to be happy without being unproductive. This is a problem. I try to find the most rational utilitarian answer to these trade-offs, but I frequently suffer from cognitive overload due to the complexities.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>What constitutes being "unproductive"? I think that reading, spending time on forums like this, learning new things about the universe, etc. can be very productive in utilitarian terms, if not in remunerative terms. Might you be interested in becoming a professional researcher -- say, about risks of future suffering, or about neuroscience, or about something else?<br/><br/>As far as the compounding argument, I disagree that animal charities don't have the same degree of compounding that human charities have. Since the main long-term goal of animal charities is to increase concern for animal suffering, veg outreach (and wild-animal-suffering outreach) multiplies itself through a cycle of more vegetarians -&gt; more donors -&gt; more vegetarians, and through exponential (or at least logistic) spread of memes.<br/><br/>What's more, I think the value of meme-spreading outweighs the value of accelerated human progress, because humans are going to advance eventually whether we prevent malaria or not, but concern to avoid creating more suffering by wild animals (and <a class="postlink" href="../thread/630.html">artificial sentients</a>) might never happen if we don't work on it.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>utilitymonster wrote:</cite>I also believe that helping humans is a useful way of speeding up the destruction of nature, so if you're worried about wild animal suffering, you should seriously consider helping of humans as a tool.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>This is true, and it's one reason I do favor developing-world charities over nothing. But it doesn't have a clear impact on wild-animals in the long-term future, unlike meme-spreading.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

That means if you give to a DWC recommended by them, you can be reasonably confident you’re doing about the best we could currently do in terms of developing world improvement. The others suffer in this comparison:<br/><br/>--Meta-charities ditto (though in this case it’s pretty much impossible for them to be rated in any meaningful way, since they’d basically have to review each other), though I suspect giving to Givewell and CEA to the point where they can’t use further funding is pretty close to the value of DWCs - and possibly much higher<br/><br/>--Donor-advised funds I don’t really know much about, but I think I’ve seen them criticised around here (by Alan?) for reasons that sounded convincing. In general donating to what you think are the best causes now probably beats any interest rate the market can give you (because of the compound benefits described above, which I suspect exceed any market return). The best reason for waiting would be if you expect someone to find a significantly better cause to put your money in in the fairly near future, but the only such examples I know of are GWWC’s Sabin and RESULTS research, both of which they seem to think are <br/><br/>--UM’s already discussed animal welfare. I’d add that it’s a slight casualty of circumstance, too – Givewell have denied any interest at all in it and while GWWC seem theoretically more open to looking into it, they’ve so far prioritised other research ahead of it. So while the possibility space has been well-explored, it’s harder to be confident about what the most effective group has been (obviously Alan’s done some research here, which must be worth quite a  lot, but he’s only one person working in an amateur capacity, so we have to be cautious about putting too much confidence in his conclusions)<br/><br/>--X-risk only has a couple of organisations working on it, so (arguably) less of the possibility-space of X-risk research has been explored. None of those organisations have been reviewed and rated highly by disinterested assessors. (also most X-risk research in practice doesn't seem to have much real world-relevance outside the cause the researchers are focusing on, so again it loses out on compounding benefits<br/><br/>I would like to see the metacharities put some effort into animal/environmental* causes though, since it seems like they could make some quick gains by applying the same cost-benefit methodology to the hundreds of groups that exist in both, whereas with developing world health metaevaluation they might have plucked most of the low hanging fruit.**<br/><br/>* I know there’s a case for environmental degradation being a good thing, but at the very least where it affects humans – climate change for eg – there’s the possibility of the same type of compounding gains from reducing it, not to mention some possible x-risk bonuses from reducing wars and social instability fought over resources etc.<br/><br/>** I have no idea if they actually have yet – UM might be able to offer more info on this.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

It's also because there's 10.000 times less academic research on animal outreach than on developing-world health, so these things will almost necessarily be "less rigorous" until research catches up.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>None of those organisations have been reviewed and rated highly by disinterested assessors.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Of course, presumably many of the donors were disinterested before they started donating?

It's true <a class="postlink" href="http://blog.givewell.org/2007/01/11/who-should-i-help-my-friend-or-my-pet/">even for GiveWell</a>:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I really don’t understand why anyone would waffle on this issue because it seems incredibly clear.

Because they’re animals.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>But to be fair, I should also quote from <a class="postlink" href="http://blog.givewell.org/2007/01/11/who-should-i-help-my-friend-or-my-pet/#comment-120253">Holden's follow-up comment</a>:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>This is a very old post, but I wanted to comment since it continues to get strong reactions.<br/><br/>I personally agree with the basic idea that, all else equal, it’s much better to help a human than to help an animal.

The claim that we should donate to developing-world health in order to destroy the environment seems implausible, because the cause has not been chosen with maximal wildlife reduction in mind. Maybe it would turn out after extensive analysis that the same charity that maximizes GiveWell's health criteria also maximally prevents suffering in the wild, but this seems unlikely.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

This really is relevant for those of you who claim that stopping wild animal suffering is the best cause.<br/><br/>Thought experiment: Two Romans want to destroy as much wildlife as possible. Roman #1 tries to come up with a sophisticated, more targeted method of destroying wildlife, such as torching forests, persuading others to torch forests, starting a logging company, spreading anti-speciesist memes, preaching vegetarianism, or discrediting the people who preach reverence for nature. Roman #2 just tries to empower human beings as much as he can. Roman #2 would probably destroy more wildlife than Roman #1, once you account for all the long-term compounding of that human empowerment (note that it either wasn't exponential growth back then, or was much slower growth).</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

But a lot of people do give to developing-world charities, and their behavior makes sense only if they haven't considered the alternatives or if they have considered the alternatives and see developing-world charities as the best cause.

Far more money goes to DWCs than to the alternatives I mentioned, so we should expect a lower marginal return. Ignorance and biases probably explain the preference for DWCs over the more abstract, delayed, or non-human benefits offered by the alternatives. <br/><br/>Even if I'm wrong about this, though, it seems to me that DWCs would be a poor choice. That DWCs have been investigated by GiveWell and GWWC doesn't seem like a good reason to donate to them. This reasoning reminds me of the joke about the drunk who looked for his keys under the street lamp because that's where the light was. It would make more sense to shine more light on other areas where the keys may be, by funding research about charities in other areas.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>--X-risk only has a couple of organisations working on it, so (arguably) less of the possibility-space of X-risk research has been explored.

The company goes bankrupt and she dies, so all her children starve to death. Another single mom buys enough life insurance that her children could do OK if she dies, and she invests the rest of her savings so that they might be able to attend college.<br/><br/>Our society seems to be following the first mom's strategy. There are lots of people inventing new things, empowering others, and educating themselves. There are almost no people trying to save humanity from extinction.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="3"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The big argument for waiting is, of course, "returns to wisdom" -- which is the only way you can potentially get a 1 trillion percent annual compounding of value, short of fantasy scenarios where the Lords of the Matrix give you superpowers.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>On reflection, this seems potentially self-defeating in practice. If you know nothing about metaresearch, it's surely better to give now (there's a chance our knowledge of charities will get worse etc). If you know enough to have a specific expectation that some group will discover something even better, then it seems like rather than investing you might do best to <span style="font-style: italic">fund that group</span> - unless you think their only effect will be to change your donation habits. Given the amount of money Givewell have redirected, this seems unlikely.<br/><br/>Even if you think that group is unlikely to find anything better but is merely the best-equipped group to do so, it might still be worth funding them so that if they produce a null result, other people following the wait-and-see approach will be able to start giving their money away to the best causes sooner.<br/><br/>Needs a more rigorous argument, I know - this only just occurred to me.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>Givewell have denied any interest at all in it and while GWWC seem theoretically more open to looking into it, they’ve so far prioritised other research ahead of it.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Of course, GiveWell has openly acknowledged that this is partly because of their own values rather than the area itself, but yes, they claim it's also partly because of the area. </div></blockquote><br/><br/>Yeah, I meant to caveat against the idea that this was any fault of the animal groups, but it's still a factor against supporting them.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Of course, presumably many of the donors were disinterested before they started donating? (I'm not necessarily defending xrisk groups; I'm just making a general comment.)</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Sure, I'm thinking of a thorough professional Givewell-esque assessment rather than individuals' retrospectively reported decisions, though.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>And GiveWell isn't disinterested -- just "differently interested." (Political correctness, yo.)</div></blockquote><br/><br/>They might be that true, but I'd say they're definitely disinterested in the sense of having little stake in the outcome (pedantry, yo <img alt=":P" src="../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif"/>)<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Pat wrote:</cite>I agree, but it seems to me that the prima facie case for DWCs is weaker than that for meta-charity, existential risk, or animal welfare. </div></blockquote><br/><br/>I was not trying to say this was necessarily a big factor - I basically agree with what utilitymonster's written here and think it's main argument against animal welfare causes at least. I was just adding that for anyone who does think it's close, there's this other factor.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Far more money goes to DWCs than to the alternatives I mentioned, so we should expect a lower marginal return.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Not clear to me - 'DWCs' is a huge umbrella term, and many of the groups in it are very underfunded. That's one of the main reasons GWWC and GW found such huge discrepancies between various groups who'd come under it.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Ignorance and biases probably explain the preference for DWCs </div></blockquote><br/><br/>I think this is just equivalent to saying you disagree with them.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I'd think that as long as an x-risk organization actually reduces existential risk, </div></blockquote><br/><br/>I have a big problem with x-risk <span style="font-style: italic">organisations</span> precisely because people freely make this assumption on little evidence. It's very hard for an x-risk-research org to show that they've actually acheived anything, since generally speaking they'll struggle to show proof of concept. If something we hadn't realised might kill us doesn't kill us, it's going to be hard to know whether it was ever a genuine threat. If it does kill us, the argument is obviously irrelevant.<br/><br/>What's more, x-risk organisations can't just use Pascalian reasoning to say 'x-risk is so important that you shouldn't fund anyone else', because every organisation has some effect on it. Ones whose economic benefits compound might well have a much better long-term prospect than short-sightedly funding a few underinformed researchers in the relative dark ages rather than - say - building a robust economy that gets us greater scientific wisdom sooner and greater total resources to throw at the problem in 50 years time.<br/><br/>I don't usually like burden of proof arguments, but I think they apply very thoroughly here - DWC (and animal welfare causes) already have <span style="font-style: italic">great </span>cost-benefit ratios, so to take a rational altruist's money away from them, x-risk orgs need to show not only that they reduce x-risk, but that they do it better than anyone else.<br/><br/>And when you account for compounding welfare benefits, x-risk no longer has dominion over Pascalian arguments a 1% chance of saving 10^10 lives might amount to 10^8 ‘lives saved’, but if those lives will otherwise have 10 hedons apiece (meaning you’ve bought 10^9 expected hedons), then assuming you’d instead gone for a 1% chance of increasing their welfare by a factor of 10 conditional on them surviving, you’d have bought up to (0.99*10^10*10)/100 hedons – about the same gain.<br/><br/>So then numbers would really start to matter again – you’d be looking at whether expected hedons conditional on survival were a better buy than hedons generated by avoiding x-risk. DWCs might well be a primary candidate for the former, since they have more memetic value and wider benefits than X-risk research.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Our society seems to be following the first mom's strategy.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Disagree. Our society has a few dominant cells in the single mum's liver sucking huge amounts of resources in, and not really bothering to clean up afterwards primarily to the benefit of the same few liver cells and their progeny.

By ignorance, I meant that (for example) most people don't realize that there's a good chance humans will go extinct in the next few hundred years, that animals account for most of the suffering on earth, that you can't just give money to a charity that sent you a solicitation and expect that the money will anywhere near as much good as if you made an informed decision. Basically, the things that Alan mentioned:<br/><blockquote><div><cite>Alan Dawrst wrote:</cite> Seven years ago, I knew basically nothing about insect suffering, strong AI, the doomsday argument, the simulation argument, anthropics, decision theory, reinforcement learning, or many of the other topics discussed here. I didn't know that Vegan Outreach or The Humane League existed. I thought preserving fauna-rich wildlife was a really important cause. I had just begun to learn that animals could feel conscious pain. What a difference seven years of wisdom makes!</div></blockquote><br/>Eliezer Yudkowsky, senior crackpot at the Singularity Institution for the Arrantly Insane, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.singularity.org/files/CognitiveBiases.pdf">has a list</a> of biases that militate against concern about existential risk. Some of the ones that make the most sense to me are<br/>* Availability: Threats to the survival of humanity necessarily don't make many dramatic appearances, while most people know that people in the developing world are poor and could use some help. Similarly, animal suffering doesn't get much airtime.<br/>* Scope neglect. Way more animals and future beings than current humans.<br/>* Pluralistic ignorance. If this is such an important issue, why aren't more people doing something about it? Partly because they're asking the same question.<br/><br/>I also think the case against speciesism is sufficiently strong for it to be considered a bias.<br/><br/>I'm trying to concretize the case for donating to DWCs. Here's what I came up with:<br/><br/>1) If you donate to the Against Malaria Foundation, it'll be able to distribute more nets.<br/>2) These nets will improve the recipients' health.<br/>3) Better health will allow the recipients to to become more economically productive. The rate of economic growth will increase.<br/>4) Enormous welfare gains will result.<br/><br/>maybe also<br/><br/>4a) After a while, people will become so rich that they will choose to spend more money on metacharities or x-risk research.<br/><br/>I haven't seen a case for (3). If we can't assume that x risk organizations reduce x risk, we shouldn't assume that the AMF increases economic growth, especially since that's not even its goal. (My guess is that in expectation, spending money on x-risk research decreases x risk and spending money on mosquito nets increases growth.) How do we know that the AMF is the best charity for promoting economic growth? It was evaluated according to different criteria. Maybe we should promote globalization, or fund economically productive research, or invest in developing countries. <br/><br/>I'm not sure about (3), either. I might be 10,000 times as rich as Socrates, but I'm not 10,000 times as happy as he was. Economic growth in the developing world would bring improved health care and nutrition, then it would bring cars and iPads and existential angst. It's not clear that welfare changes in the future will be for the better. Maybe we'll become workaholics or be tortured by religious zealots.<br/><br/>Do people really buy an argument like the one I outlined above? Do they believe it with such certainty that they'd rather give now than wait or support research into the question?<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Our society seems to be following the first mom's strategy.</div></blockquote><br/>Disagree. Our society has a few dominant cells in the single mum's liver sucking huge amounts of resources in, and not really bothering to clean up afterwards primarily to the benefit of the same few liver cells and their progeny. To put it another way, I don't think this is a useful analogy <img alt=":P" src="../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif"/></div></blockquote><br/>I think you're right about the metaphor. But I think I'm right that far more resources—from workers, entrepreneurs, governments, corporations, universities, etc.—go into increasing economic growth than go into reducing the risk of extinction, and that ratio is probably not optimized for maximizing total economic productivity over the rest of history.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I think cultured meat - or any meat alternative that meets the criteria of cost, subjective quality, nutrition and cultural acceptance of real meat would be a breakthrough technology. It could solve the poor meat-eater problem, prevent billions of torture incidents all over the globe and enable humans to see animals as fellow sentient beings without having to rationalize why they cut out body parts of their screaming bodies as an industry routine. I'm not sure NH is the perfect choice, but it's the one I would make if I had to choose right now.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div><blockquote><div><cite>Hedonic Treader wrote:</cite>I have not found a way to be really productive without being miserable, or to be happy without being unproductive. This is a problem. I try to find the most rational utilitarian answer to these trade-offs, but I frequently suffer from cognitive overload due to the complexities.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>What constitutes being "unproductive"? I think that reading, spending time on forums like this, learning new things about the universe, etc. can be very productive in utilitarian terms, if not in remunerative terms. Might you be interested in becoming a professional researcher -- say, about risks of future suffering, or about neuroscience, or about something else?<br/></div></blockquote><br/>By "unproductive", I meant doing things other than earn money efficiently. I agree not all of these things are useless in a utilitarian sense, but money is the unit of caring and it moves people more reliably than many other interactions. Switching careers would incur transition costs and not necessarily make me happier - instead I adjust my work-life balance to psychologically sustainable levels.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>As far as the compounding argument, I disagree that animal charities don't have the same degree of compounding that human charities have. Since the main long-term goal of animal charities is to increase concern for animal suffering, veg outreach (and wild-animal-suffering outreach) multiplies itself through a cycle of more vegetarians -&gt; more donors -&gt; more vegetarians, and through exponential (or at least logistic) spread of memes.</div></blockquote><br/>Maybe it depends on the nature of the animal charity. It is entirely possible that there still is untapped potential, but I'm not sure how giving money to these charities unlocks that potential efficiently (as compared to raising the relevant points in related discussions when it is appropriate), and where diminishing returns set in. For instance, I don't think there are many non-vegetarians/vegans who have never heard the arguments from PETA campaigns etc. It isn't clear to me that many more people are available for cheap "conversion".<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>utilitymonster wrote:</cite>I also believe that helping humans is a useful way of speeding up the destruction of nature, so if you're worried about wild animal suffering, you should seriously consider helping of humans as a tool.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>If poor people become more wealthy, they may use more resources, but also have fewer children. Population growth is one of the factors that accelerates destruction of ecosystems. Furthermore, there may be backlash effects when too much nature is destroyed in a way that interferes with human needs. If partial environmental collapse can make people poor again, the rest of nature will probably (?) recover.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

(AMF probably increases the kinds of growth people usually care about.) But it could be much less effective than, say, lobbying to increase government funding of science research.</div></blockquote><br/>I hadn't thought of that. That could quite possibly be more effective than lobbying against trade and immigration restrictions. In the interest of exploring the realm of possibilities, here are a few more ideas.<br/><br/>Many European countries have relatively inflexible workforces (i.e., unions are prevalent and it's difficult to fire people). In addition, these countries tend to have high levels of taxation. Through market-oriented reforms, they would be able to sustainably boost their growth rate. (This would probably have to wait till Europe sorts out its current problems.) So you could try to influence policy in these nations, through contributions to political campaigns (this might be difficult if you're a foreigner), think tanks, or organizations that lobby. [ETA: I guess I shouldn't have singled out European countries, since policy in the US is by no means optimized for economic growth. The tax code could be made more efficient, corporate welfare and military spending could be reduced, etc. But there's probably more low-hanging fruit in Europe (see <a class="postlink" href="http://www.heritage.org/index/ranking">http://www.heritage.org/index/ranking</a>). P.S. I'm not a political conservative.]<br/><br/>You could invest in venture capital. In this area, it seems that you could make a bigger difference on the margin than you would by investing in the S&amp;P 500 (I could well be wrong about this; I'm not well-versed in economics).<br/><br/>Other areas of aid, such as education or microlending, might become more attractive relative to global health if evaluated on their contribution to long-term economic growth.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="3">I very much doubt political lobbying for well-known causes is ever a good use of a utilitarian’s time or money. Aside from the epistemic and factual uncertainties (eg does maximised economic growth actually foster development more than controlled growth in key areas? And what actually is ‘economic growth’? If we produce twice as many felt-tip pens this year as the year before and everything else remains constant, has our economy grown?), the marginal value of your dollar is much lower when more people have already tried to achieve the same goal, and possibly approaching zero if the opposing groups are obtuse enough (eg how much more money must have gone into anti-healthcare propaganda when Obama made the possibility of state-funded medicine tangible than beforehand?). <br/><br/>In general, if we want some particular thing (say better developing world health), it seems much more cost-effective to find the best existing causes in that area and fund them directly than to fund political groups to press for that thing, which even if it gets through will almost certainly do so in some watered down version (eg if the govt diverted £50million to developing world tomorrow, it’s pretty unlikely it would all go to AMF, SCI and DtW).<br/><br/>I would weight the epistemic value of the Heritage Foundation’s answers to such questions as close to zero since their explicit goal is to promote their views and since those views coincide with a lot of influential people’s self-interest - and have no testable consequences.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Other age demographics could be targeted as well, with probably at most a factor of 2 or 3 reduction in effectiveness? And the ads I'm thinking of are mainly for the US, but they could be done globally, and with lower costs per click. In other words, probably the ads could be increased many times their current scale without running out of people to target.

I think there *is* a lot of evidence that certain levels of health correlate with economic growth (eg the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289611000286">correlation of health with IQ</a>. It’s by no means clear, but again the Pascalian argument seems to apply – you only need to be fractionally more confident about the compounding benefits of X than those of Y for X to have massively higher expectation.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2">Speaking of memetic concerns, another reason to consider giving to developing world charities is a good base through which you can use to convince other people to become large-scale donors.  A large portion of people are too speciesist to consider giving to animal-welfare charities, even among those who are or would donate a substantial portion of their income.<br/><br/>I live in a world where many of my friends and family think a worthwhile donation is to the local Goodwill or to the concert hall.  It's hard enough to convince people to donate to the developing world where you can save *human* lives for fairly cheap, let alone convince them to begin to value animal lives and then donate to their welfare.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2"><blockquote><div><cite>Brian Tomasik wrote:</cite>But where animals do have a chance, I'd rather go for the gold.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I'd sympathize with that.  A lot of my problems are personal conflicts between a desire for ideal utilitarianism and my current situation.  I will now heap my woes onto an unsuspecting you, though I don't want to derail the thread:<br/><br/>I'm still a college student, so my income is in the $4000/year range, though I intend to work more this upcoming year to make more income.  I've currently been doing my best to be frugal and donating 10% of that amount to Givewell, but that was before I came to value nonhuman animals (reading your utilitarian essays helped in part with that!).<br/><br/>Now, I've been working on being as vegan as possible, though the best I've cobbled together so far is a greatly-reduced-eggs occasional-sushi vegetarianism.  I face a fair amount of social pressure -- some of my college friends are vegetarian, but I only know one vegan.  None of my family is vegetarian.  None of my friends or family are willing to donate any more than 2% of their income.<br/><br/>Lastly, all my donation finances go through my dad.  I haven't told him that I'm vegetarian/vegan yet.  I don't really know how I'm going to go against the grain of my family like that.  I also don't know how I'd get him to know I'm donating to something like out there like non-global-warming existential risk (SIAI) or Vegan Outreach/New Harvest.<br/><br/>I don't want this to make it sound like I'm unhappy -- I'm not.  But I'm confused about how to go about living more closely with my values.<br/><br/>////<br/><br/>Lastly and unrelatedly, does anyone know if there are any attempts to get current vegan utilitarian philanthropists to donate to animal welfare charities?  I'm definitely thinking Peter Singer here.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

That said, I'm not a fan of eating fish (especially small fish) because it takes a lot of them to produce a given quantity of meat. You might consider eating <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-per-kg.html">more dairy</a> if you want to keep the amount of animal protein constant.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>peterhurford wrote:</cite>I face a fair amount of social pressure -- some of my college friends are vegetarian, but I only know one vegan.

OTOH, it means there's more upside if you can persuade others to get interested in these topics.<br/><br/>In addition, you can make more friends who can pressure you in the right direction. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/> For example, you can find some of us on Facebook <a class="postlink" href="../thread/422.html">here</a> or <a class="postlink" href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/suffering.in.nature/">here</a> or <a class="postlink" href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/utilitarianism/">here</a>.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>peterhurford wrote:</cite>I also don't know how I'd get him to know I'm donating to something like out there like non-global-warming existential risk (SIAI) or Vegan Outreach/New Harvest.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>I guess it's a risk to figure out whether he'll go for "strange" donations. How big is the downside? Maybe it could make your relationship more awkward? Might it also mean less financial support in the future? How much longer will your finances go through him?<br/><br/>BTW, any ideas on your preferred charity? I currently favor <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/vegan-outreach.html">Vegan Outreach and The Humane League</a>, partly to help factory-farmed animals in the short term, but mainly to spread concern for animal suffering in general in the hopes of reducing the spread of wild-animal suffering in the far future. If an organization forms to work on wild-animal suffering directly, I'll probably favor donating to that even more.<br/><br/>Feel free to continue questions like these, either on this thread or on some others that relate to the topic. Discussing life-relevant questions is one of the most valuable functions of the Felicifia community.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>peterhurford wrote:</cite>Lastly and unrelatedly, does anyone know if there are any attempts to get current vegan utilitarian philanthropists to donate to animal welfare charities?

For almost anything you do, some people will dislike it.<br/><br/>Of course, pleasing people isn't the goal. Many of us take at least a few positions that are quite unpopular and could easily boost our popularity by changing our stance.<br/><br/>But I guess I'm just making an intuitive point that we shouldn't be too worried when people oppose our beliefs, because this is not abnormal in a diverse world.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Pretty much I didn't get to read anything until the first post that mentions my name so what I say about giving to developing-world charities must have been stated previously.<br/><br/>Starting January 1st, 2012 I give 50% of my income to Against Malaria Foundation (as per GiveWell recommendation). I occasionally send off $50 to animal rights groups (VeganOutreach or The Humane League as per Brian Tomasik's recommendations). I'm still young in my giving (only 2 years as part of Giving What We Can and before that wasn't giving much). I care about (wild) animal suffering and am aware of the immediate problem(s) affluence for more people will cause animals (more factory farms). I'm also aware of x-risks.<br/><br/>One way seems reasonable to reconcile these problems (and I'm all ears about other ways to see it all) is to prevent complete human extinction (unless all organisms die on earth many animals in the wild will suffer for millions of years). There are many approaches to tackle x-risks, but as of now there isn't a clearly great organization doing work like that (combating AI threat seems necessary though at this point who is doing it well?). The best model I see to personally help at this time is to decrease extreme inequities in the world - these are likely to cause wars, political instability, and perhaps most crucially, thus, short-term thinking. <br/><br/>In the short-term suffering may increase for animals as more people become wealthy, but hopefully (is this reasonable to expect?) people will turn their attention to problems like over-pollution, unsustainable consumption, etc; basically more long-term thinking which will hopefully significantly decrease x-risks. In due time (as we're seeing already) more and more people will be on board with animal rights.<br/><br/>ps - we live in an exciting/scary time. Never has any individual been so able to help/hurt so many. There are problems that could wipe out all human beings, and we're in near-reach of technological solutions to many of these problems. <br/><br/>pps - I don't mean to suggest my model of how to help is the best for everyone; for example persuasive individuals may have better impact directly helping another important issue. Perhaps getting more people to learn from positive psychology would be a shorter path to a happier life for all, a peaceful co-existence where there is a strong cultural norm against greed that has driven some of the financial disasters; perhaps targeted rationality education implemented in schools would guard future generations from anti-intellectual anti-scientific thinking within governments. <br/><br/>ppps - how many of you have heard of Leverage Research <img alt=";)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif"/></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I didn't mean to single you out, you were just one of the few vegan philanthropists (and by philanthropists, I mean those in the GWWC / smart giving / Peter Singer / optimal philanthropy movements) that came to mind, and I was interested in hearing your perspective, as others.<br/><br/>I don't know that many current philanthropists that are also concerned for nonhuman animal suffering, but I'd even be curious to hear the perspectives of those who don't value nonhuman animals.  Let me know if you have any contacts.<br/><br/>~<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>yboris wrote:</cite>The best model I see to personally help at this time is to decrease extreme inequities in the world - these are likely to cause wars, political instability, and perhaps most crucially, thus, short-term thinking.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Definitely.  The concern I share here and with many other donation targets is the guesswork involved with how we're steering the future with our donations.  I think such guesswork is very important and maybe even necessary to making a donation, but I try not to give it much credit.  (And I don't demean "guesswork" to just replace doing something with smug skepticism, but rather to maybe think priorities lie in better research.)<br/><br/>That being said, I definitely do think it established that helping rid the world of deaths by malaria (as the AMF would do) does create positive upward pressure on a lot of other social problems.  I recall GiveWell's few discussions about how sometimes the problems in developing world education, overpopulation, and extreme poverty are the result, at least in large part, of the disease burden.<br/><br/>~<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>yboris wrote:</cite>ps - we live in an exciting/scary time.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2">It's not obvious to me whether poverty reduction decreases or increases extinction risk. In the short term, I would guess that economic development and education <span style="font-style: italic">increase</span> extinction risk, because more technology implies more potential for disaster. Before nuclear weapons, there was no artificial way to kill off all humans.<br/><br/>That said, you probably only care about futures in which humans advance to a super-technological civilization, and in that case, the increased risk of extinction due to technology might be seen as "growing pains" that we have to go through at one time or another, with no way to avoid them. Even if so, it's still not clear why speeding up technology would make us safer; at best, it seems pretty much neutral in terms of extinction risk? (I'm assuming a sufficiently low chance of natural extinction in the meanwhile.)<br/><br/>In any event, it's <a class="postlink" href="../thread/537.html">not obvious to me</a> if reducing extinction risks is an ideal goal.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">If we assume a pessimistic view of nature (wild animals experiencing net-negative utility), then human civilization has the direct impact of replacing these systems - maybe with something that already has or will soon have net-positive utility (content humans, happy pets etc.), or something that simply contains less sentience density (comparatively large living space per human in western nations, lots of agricultural land where there once were forests). These assumptions would have to be assessed quantitatively. It is probable that poverty reduction increases this effect (smaller families, more resource use per capita).<br/><br/>In case of a technology-driven big future (high sentience density per resources, space colonization, speculative physics tech), it depends both on the probability of the scenario and the expected utility average that dominates it.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">I agree that it is definitely uncertain (and could go either way) whether or not developing world charities decrease existential risk, and I imagine they have much less impact on x-risk than donating to, say, the SIAI.

I'm a regular donor to VO, and this year, upon discovering Nick's work with veg ads, I told VO that I wanted to fund veg ads with my donation. They agreed, and one of their employees is now working with Nick to set up the landing page and the ads campaign.<br/><br/>I've put some pictures of VO's ads at the very bottom of my <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/veg-ads.html">veg-ads piece</a>. As noted there, "The updated ads do not contain 'veganoutreach.org' underneath the title, which should help avoid scaring away those who aren't already sympathetic." I've also suggested that VO might avoid mentioning vegetarianism at all, in case that brings in more of the unconverted and fewer of the already-converted; they haven't yet gotten a chance to try this.<br/><br/>In addition to The Humane League and Vegan Outreach, another group running online ads is <a class="postlink" href="http://vegfund.org/">VegFund</a>. I think all of these groups are good, although I know most about The Humane League's work and so can vouch for it most strongly. I also appreciate the fact that The Humane League does a lot of R&amp;D around ad experimentation as well as measurement of impact on the target audience through <a class="postlink" href="http://www.thehumaneleague.com/extra/FacebookAdsSurveyResults2011.pdf">follow-up surveys</a>.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

What do you think about animal charities that promote hardcore anti-speciesism more directly? This isn't usual in America and USA, but there are several Spanish and South-Americans charities with that approach (they promote veganism too, but not only). When I speak with Spanish and South-American vegans (where it's more usual that vegans are anti-speciesist), I can see that a lot of them accept the wild-animal suffering issue very easily.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

The 80K project doesn't yet have a website, but if you PM me your email address, I can send along some info. Either way, we'll no doubt announce more on Felicifia later in the summer.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Hedonic Treader wrote:</cite>or that it just shifts meat consumption to people who would otherwise not have been able to afford it.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Ignoring long-term changes to market dynamics, we can quantify the extent of this effect through elasticities. Bailey Norwood does so in <span style="font-style: italic"><a class="postlink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Compassion-Pound-Economics-Animal-Welfare/dp/0199551162">Compassion by the Pound</a></span>. I don't have that book at the moment, but I do <a class="postlink" href="http://reducing-suffering.blogspot.com/2009/07/ham-and-eggonomics-part-2.html">have figures from an earlier draft</a>, which was called <span style="font-style: italic">Ham and Eggonomics</span>:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>If [someone] gives up Total Consumption of ... the Product Falls By ...<br/>One Pound of Milk 0.56 lbs<br/>One Pound of Beef 0.68 lbs<br/>One Pound of Veal 0.69 lbs<br/>One Pound of Pork 0.74 lbs<br/>One Pound of Chicken 0.76 lbs<br/>One Egg 0.91 egg.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>It's fascinating that the animal products that are least bad in terms of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-per-kg.html">direct suffering per pound purchased</a> are also the ones that, if cut back, also cause the least reduction in total production.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Hedonic Treader wrote:</cite>It's not clear to me that awareness of human-made animal abuse automatically translates to a net reduction in animal suffering.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Definitely. The causal pathways of the future are very murky. But it seems like promoting antispeciesism, such as through mass veg outreach, is one of the better ways to improve prospects for the long-term future of wild animals. Other options are the direct antispeciesist charities that Daniel cited. Apart from a charity that talks about wild-animal suffering directly, can you think of better things do to? Perhaps promoting fake meat?<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Hedonic Treader wrote:</cite>Yes, I thought that too. However, I also like the famous veg role-model approach if the target audience is emotionally invested in those celebrities.</div></blockquote><br/>Veg role models are actually a really smart idea. They're a hook to interest people who might not care about animals but do care about celebrities. They implicitly show that it's possible to be a healthy vegetarian. And they give people motivation to emulate the famous people whom they look up to.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I agree that it is definitely uncertain (and could go either way) whether or not developing world charities decrease existential risk, and I imagine they have much less impact on x-risk than donating to, say, the SIAI. (I also agree it's unclear whether x-risk reduction would be a utilitarian good.)<br/></div></blockquote><br/><br/>It's not at all obvious how puting x-risk first could change policies in the near time. Assuming the concept applicable in long-term scenarios, the vegan/animal rights -- or more urgent causes--  movements do not have to change their goals. <br/><br/>People who are concerned with x-risk normally put a list of priorities where enviromentalism is not on the top, and in a broad perpesctive, do analysis to map influence factors. Mostly because the number of people concerned with animal suffering is superior to who bother about  x-risk. This disproportion could be one of reasons to change, but they are not mutually exclusive.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<p class="author"><img alt="Post" height="9" src="../styles/nexus/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" title="Post" width="11"/>by <strong><a href="../user/64.html">Brian Tomasik</a></strong> on 2012-12-31T14:05:00</p>
<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">EAA is interested in donations from everyone -- it's just that they don't want to recommend themselves because this would open themselves up to obvious legitimacy concerns, at least in the eyes of outsiders.<br/><br/>Anyway, I was going to add to this thread the following comment. It's occasionally claimed that one of the best things we can do for animals in the future is help people in the developing world in the present because this will foster the conditions under which people can even begin to think about altruism rather than just their own survival. I think this is very implausible in a dollar-for-dollar sense. There are tens of billions of dollars of foreign aid. The amount donated toward animals is probably in the tens/hundreds of millions per year, and the amount donated toward effective animal activism is probably a few million. The amount donated toward wild-animal suffering meme-spreading is currently zero, yet there seems to be a lot of low-hanging fruit for the wild-animal movement to harvest. So in terms of marginal use of dollars, it's dubious that contributing extra money toward international aid is the best thing we can do.<br/><br/>There's a further point, though: Does it actually matter that much if people in the developing world become altruistic? If the future will be determined by technology / seed AI made in rich countries, then what matters is the values among the wealthy people in rich countries. It won't really be harmful if people in Bangladesh aren't able to spend time on altruism for animals. Sure, we'd love it if they could, but what matters in the end is the quality of the values among the powerful. So it's not clear to me that reducing poverty has much memetic value at all? (One exception could be that in a world with less poverty, people would make up fewer excuses for why it's okay for people to stay in poverty, which would improve their ethical values. But this seems like a small effect.)</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
