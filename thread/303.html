<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Utilitarianism is a type of consequentialism. Probably most consequentialists are utilitarians.<br/><br/>Consequentialism means judging acts by their consequences.<br/><br/>Utilitarianism means judging acts by their utility (i.e. usefulness). Utilitarians tend to restrict themselves to one type of consequence. <br/>&gt; Classical utilitarians believe in improving wellbeing. <br/>&gt; Preference utilitarians believe in satisfying people's preferences<br/>&gt; Negative utilitarian believes in reducing suffering.<br/><br/>Consequentialism is a broader school of thought. Here are some varieties:<br/>&gt; Egoists believe in improving their own wellbeing and are uninterested in others' wellbeing.<br/>&gt; Prioritarians believe in promoting wellbeing, giving special consideration to worse off individuals. Prioritarians combine concern for wellbeing with concepts of justice.<br/>&gt; other consequentialists may mix and match from wide ranges of outcomes. They may hope for wellbeing. They may value justice. Perhaps they regard life as sacrosanct, and to be preserved at all costs. etc.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">What is the difference between saying that an act is moral according to it's usefulness in achieving a desirable consequence and saying that an act is moral based on it's consequences? I believe that happiness is the only thing that is intrinsically valuable and suffering is the only thing that is intrinsically dis-valuable, so I view an action is ethical only if it increases happiness or minimizes stress. What am I? I also believe that while increasing happiness is morally desirable, it isn't necessary, only minimizing suffering is morally necessary ( something is only 'necessary' if it's needed to avoid a negative consequence, being unconscious is of neutral value so, even if it's not desirable or good like happiness is, a universe without sentient beings would not be bad or dis-valuable). Am I a classic utilitarian or a negative utilitarian or what? I don't think negative hedonism is a drastically different idea than the hedonism of classical utilitarians, I think all hedonist views are based on empathy but stress clearly triggers a greater empathetic response than happiness does. Negative hedonism (I think this is a better term since not all utilitarians are hedonists) is only really relevant when it comes to creating or ending sentient life, otherwise, what increases a person's happiness will necessarily minimize their stress and vice versa. Of course we should prioritize giving food to hungry children rather than giving toys to children who already have decent lives but even a 'positive' hedonist could argue that doing so would cause the hungry child more happiness than giving a toy to the already happy child would.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">I think the difference is utilitarianism has additional axioms. According to utilitarianism:<br/>An action is equally moral no matter who takes it: This gets rid of egoism and altruism, where it's different if you do something to help you or someone else does.<br/>Morality adds linearly: if it's good to have a life barely worth living, and it's good to have extravagant wealth, having a person with each would be as good as both of those put together.

You feed data (eg circumstances) into the algorithm and it produces an answer. Consequentialism is just an umbrella name for any moral view that concerns itself exclusively with consequences, so it isn't necessarily algorithmic or even consistent. <br/><br/>Eg while utilitarians must, all things being equal, support torturing a baby for eternity if it made the rest of humankind eternally happy (a classic thought-experiment supposed to make util sound impalatable - though all things are inevitably not equal), a non-specific consequentialist might just assert 'that's an obviously awful consequence, which we should try to avoid'.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>edit : after researching a bit more on prioritarianism, I think it's the school I most identify with (prioritarians are hedonists, right?).</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Like utilitarianism, prioritarianism describes what you want to do with utility, not (necessarily) what utility is.

I believe that happiness and suffering are obviously asymmetrical in value and that causing someone to suffer is only necessary if it prevents them or other people from suffering to an even greater extent. I don't understand the idea that happiness is 'necessary' (not just desirable but a must) or that pursuing a positive is as equally valuable as avoiding a negative.  Hedonist- prioritarianism seems to be most insync with my views but I will continue to think of myself as a hedonist if anyone asks and I don't have time to go into detail.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>So what distinguishes prioritarianism from utilitarianism?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>In Prioritarianism, it's okay to cause a net decrease in happiness if you spread it out more.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>causing someone to suffer is only necessary if it prevents them or other people from suffering to an even greater extent.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>So, you'd let me punch you in the face to keep me from kicking you in the shins, but not to, uh, what's a generic example of positive utility?<br/><br/>Would you work to get money to go to a movie? The former causes suffering (assuming you don't particularly like your job), but the latter doesn't prevent it.<br/><br/>Also, if you think you need to minimize suffering before you work on happiness, you're essentially a negative utilitarian. It's always possible to sacrifice enough pleasure to decrease a little bit more pain.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">To my understanding, negative utilitarians argue that there is no moral reason to increase happiness for it's own sake. I disagree with them, I think that maximizing as much happiness as possible is morally desirable but only minimizing stress is morally <span style="font-style: italic">necessary</span> (<span style="text-decoration: underline">stress is of negative value</span>, happiness is of positive value and being emotionless is of neutral value, it's not desirable or bad. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Something is only necessary if it's needed to avoid a negative outcome, that's what 'necessary' means</span>). Let's say a magic genie came up to you and offered you a bet, if he flips a coin and it lands on heads you suffer the worst, unimaginable stress that the human nervous system is capable of and you will feel this stress every waking moment for the rest of your life (think being clinically depressed mixed in with what it must feel like to starve or be in the final stage of AIDS or cancer) but if it lands on tails, you will experience the greatest euphoria and joy that any drug could possibly produce. Are you willing to take this risk? You might want to have a billion dollars but if you already have enough money to pay for rent/mortgage, food, clothes, entertainment etc., do you need a billion dollars? Not only is happiness not necessary but it's not as practical of a moral goal as minimizing suffering is, since everyone is eventually going to die and all happiness will end. If maximizing happiness is necessary in the same way that avoiding stress is, we should be constantly grieving for every possible sentient being that could have come into exist but never will.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>So, you'd let me punch you in the face to keep me from kicking you in the shins, but not to, uh, what's a generic example of positive utility?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I might. The more pleasure someone experiences, the less sensitive they are to stress (they actually did a study on this, being exposed to high levels of stress on a continual basis conditions the brain to respond more easily to stress). Pleasure is not only intrinsically valuable, it's also instrumentally valuable in minimizing stress so whatever pleasure  compensates for being punched in the face or working overtime at a job I dislike would prevent a lot of future stress even if it wasn't necessary to avoid a specific, negative outcome. I would not let you kick me in the shin or work overtime if the stress that it caused was unbearable. There is a such thing as 'unbearable' stress, there is no such thing as too little happiness unless the absence of happiness is stressful.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

But listen to that sentence - the greatest happiness principle demands that one should grieve constantly? <br/><br/>Surely that can't be right - better to say that (if one is a totalising utilitarian) we will try to maximise happiness, but also aim to be as sanguine as possible about whatever result we actually end up with.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

The only way to eliminate that chance is to eliminate life.<br/><br/>This reminds me of the view that negligable amounts of utility can never outweigh significant amounts.

So I'm just an hedonist.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">As far as I know, negative utilitarianism does deny that happiness has intrinsic value.  Nevertheless, since mammals either feel pain, happiness negative utilitarians consider happiness.  For example, negative utilitarianism would advocate letting farmed chickens forage, so that they would avoid boredom.  It would also advocate encouraging people and other animals to spend time with family and friends or whatever brings them happiness, so that they would avoid loneliness or boredom.  So the negative utilitarian ethic is not as morose as one would imagine.  For as long as their are 'normal' genetically unmodified mammals, happiness will always be deeply tied to negative utilitarianism.  It could not be otherwise, because if a mammal goes for long enough without feeling happiness, it will become depressed.  So happiness must be promoted in order for suffering to be minimised.<br/>It is important though that negative utilitarianism does not give value to happiness, because if it did, then negative utilitarians would advocate reproduction and 'saving' unsentient entities into becoming living beings that feel both pleasure and pain.  Even the utilitarian Peter Singer, however, thinks it an absurd notion to want to 'save' non-sentient entities into becoming living beings.<br/>The question whether negative utilitarians give happiness inherent value is a useful one of Ubuntu to bring up, otherwise someone new to negative utilitarianism might think that negative utilitarians are grey cardigans who only think about suffering.  (Nor do I give grey inherent negative value.  It can be elegant in the evening.)  No.  Negative utilitarianism must consider happiness in their consideration of the living because the absence of happiness in a mammal will result in suffering.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

In practice, the only person I know of who self-identifies as an NU is David Pearce, who seems very much concerned with promoting happiness. I don't really know how he weighs it compared to suffering reduction. Most of what I've read by him fits your idea removing suffering without just killing someone equates to making them happier - but I doubt he'd say that's necessarily true.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

From a hedonistic utilitarian point of view, the identity of the beings who experience happiness and stress is morally irrelevant, it's the actual experience of happiness or stress that is valuable or dis-valuable. Anti-natalists simply want to prevent more aversive experience from coming into existence.<br/><br/>I agree that negative utilitarians must acknowledge that happiness is valuable if for no other reason than the fact that it is antithetical to stress but that's different from claiming that happiness has intrinsic, positive value. Given the option of a universe where every sentient being was in a constant state of unimaginable joy and euphoria (no distress whatsoever) and a universe with no sentient beings, I would much prefer the former and I don't see why anyone would not. If distress is of intrinsic, negative value than happiness <span style="font-style: italic">has</span> to be of intrinsic, positive value because happiness (and not just the absence of distress) is the opposite of distress and there is a positive to every negative. What does the word 'utilitarianism' mean? According to wikipedia, a 'utilitarian' is someone who believes that the moral worth of an action is determined solely by it's usefulness in maximizing utility but that doesn't mean that 'positive' utilitarians deny that negative utility is, just that, of negative value, it just means that their focus is on maximizing positive utility. What about the word '<span style="font-style: italic">negative utili</span>tarian' entails a belief that happiness is not of positive value? The word simply implies that negative utilitarians are focused on minimizing negative utility rather than maximizing positive utility, not that they literally deny that the opposite of negative utility is positive utility.<br/><br/>I think I've finally figured out the difference between negative utilitarianism and prioritarianism. <br/><br/>-will edit<br/><br/>edit : I hate my computer</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Hi guys<br/><br/>An interesting thread. Someone said "As far as I know everyone here disagrees with the averaging method (which you could in theory apply to any type of consequentialism), though you might find the more popular summing method equally repugnant."<br/>Well I am a consequentialist  but the averaging method, as I understand it, does not apply to my approach. In order for it to apply there would have to be some form of intrinsic value to apply it to but since I have seen no strong,valid and sound argument in favour of any form of intrinsic value (e.g. Mackie's argument from queerness), which leads me to reject this and hence any form of utility, however distributed (utilitarianism, egoism, altruism, prioritorism, egalitarianism etc.). The point being that the averaging or totalising method can only apply of there is a utility to average or total. That does not prevent me being a consequentialist (all value is extrinsic coupled with value pluralism, specifically where these are not commensurable nor reducible to one single dimension, scale ... or utility). There are other consequences apart from utility.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Will and Daniel<br/><br/>Hi Will, you say that "that the motivation for utilitarianism is, to a great extent, the belief that a theory is more likely to be right if it is simple and elegant. I think that's why the mathematically inclined are often the most sympathetic to utilitarianism. Utilitarianism answers a lot of different questions at once, and always chooses the simplest answer."<br/><br/>First I would say this is a motivation for consequentialism, of which utilitarianism(s) was the probably first and certainly the best know variant(s). <br/><br/>Secondly this is only one of the abductive principles to justify a theory and on its own is insufficient.  It is rather that, I think most of us here would agree,  consequentialism is the inference to the best explanation for normative ethics. Within that area, we can dispute amongst ourselves as to which is the better variant, which is what this forum is for.<br/><br/>And this brings me to Daniel's comment, of which only the first half was addressed to me. <br/><br/>You ask "Would you agree that if A is better than B, and B is better than C, than A is better than C? If so, it is possible to give a value to each possible universe and compare them using those." Again I have two responses.<br/><br/>So what I say. Why? Well whatever I think you and others might think otherwise. That is we can have differential orderings of A.B and C. Because what I value can be different to what you value, that is value is incommensurate and plural. Even if we agree on the same ordering here, we can find some where we would disagree. And I say that the issue is the insistence upon a utility to impose unilaterally on everyone, which is why I reject utilitarianism but not consequentialism - which, to return to my original point - does not make a utility necessary.<br/><br/>And that leads to my second response. It does not matter which universe we prefer, only beings within those universes matter and what matters is only what matters to them. If a being in A prefers B where they do not exist over A, then B is of more value to them than A. Other beings in A might disagree or not.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>If there's no one utility function to use, how do you decide what to do?<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Like anyone else of course. That is, everyone usually seeks to substitute a more fulfilling state of affairs for a lesser one and they do that by seeking to fulfil the more and stronger of their desires, given their beliefs. Adding "utility functions" is either trivially empty and true or substantively false (if the implication is that everyone should  have the same utility function).<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>What I meant was, take my comment and replace the words "moral system" with "utility function".</div></blockquote><br/>Yes I understood that and asked what that is do with morality.<br/><br/>You mean like this?<br/><br/>"The idea that different people have different <span style="font-style: italic">utility functions</span> and no one system is right sounds very nice, but when you actually have to make a decision it doesn't really help."<br/>But this is no longer looks like  a question of morality when I have now made the substitution you suggested. Morality is concerned about normativity, that is what people <span style="font-style: italic">ought</span> to do, not what they do  do. Yet this sentence no longer addresses such issues. The other sentences I have already addressed in previous comments (as i had this one too).<br/><br/>Further It is wrong, since it  does help in making decisions. That is it is usually of benefit if you are aware that different people can have different motivations, and the better you are at determining those motivations then the better you are at deciding how to bring successfully about what you desire.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
