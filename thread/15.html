<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Hey, I'm interested in fielding your opinions on the application of utilitarianism to drugs. The obvious hypothetical application comes from the classic political novel Brave New World. In the words of Wikipedia,<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="font-weight: bold">Wikipedia says:</span>All members of society are conditioned in childhood to hold the values that the World State idealizes. Constant consumption is the bedrock of stability for the World State; everyone is encouraged to consume the ubiquitous drug, soma. Soma is a mild hallucinogen that makes it possible for everyone to be blissfully oblivious. It has no short-term side effects and induces no hangover; long-term abuse leads to death by respiratory failure.</div></blockquote><br/>My first question is "Is a lack of political freedom an excessive price to pay for such pleasure?"<br/><br/>If you have not read Brave New World, or if for some other reason that example does not work for you, I can recall a similar example from a man's stand-up routine. He said in quite colourful language, that he wished that in the future, people should be allowed to lie in baths of protein with a wire running into the brain constantly stimulating sexual pleasure centres. So is this sort of situation something you'd consider desirable?<br/><br/>I won't pre-empt your responses except by saying that your approach to these situation might depend on your conception of utility. If hedonistic pleasures like food, sex and drugs count as utility, then soma and the protein bath sound fairly desirable. That's not necessarily the case for someone who understands utility to mean a deeper wellbeing or satisfaction of preferences.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

The electronic stimulation of the pleasure centres of our brain *has* to count as utility, however that's measured. There is, surely, no way for a  person to be happier. As for the other example - I'm willing to cede that a life spent eating chocolate and drinking champagne might not be as 'enjoyable' as other forms of lives - this isn't quite what you were getting at, but I think one key difference is that a life spent doing the things that make an individual ahppy in the short term will not necessarily make him happy in the long term. But with soma and other related hypothetical drugs, I would advocate their use - iirc, lab rats chose to press buttons activating their pleasure centres for long enough that they died of starvation, as they preferred the pleasure to food. <br/>Whether one specific individual should be allowed to take this route is a different question; my life would be noticeably worse if a family member or close friend chose to do this. I've got no idea how much utility an individual gains versus how much his contacts would lose from his decision to remove himself from the population - until the option exists for *all* individuals to electrocute their pleasure centres [when it would make sense to take it] then it's more of a grey area. <br/><br/>I did think when I read it that BNW was a utopia, not a dystopia, and I haven't changed my mind since...<br/><br/>Joe</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I agree on the second point, though I'm not actually convinced that it's particularly unpleasant on the whole - Huxley tries to turn us against it by writing the entire thing from the perspective of the (emotionally) worst-off person in it, which is a pretty cheap trick.

I was chatting to an English student about this recently and she made basically the same point, but from an English student's POV that authorial intent is key, rather than a philosopher's POV that the book is only relevant as a way of ensuring that we're talking about the same kind of hypothetical world with a drug to make people happy. I definitely agree with you in that the least happy person on Earth is much, much less happy than any BNW citizens.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

It wouldn't inspire me to write much, if that's what you mean, mainly because it wasn't that good a novel.

[Using classical utilitarianism including positive and negative wellbeing] I don't think the repugnant conclusion is as bad as it intuitively seems to be. It tells us to imagine millions of lives barely worth living. We intuitively dislike this scenario because:<br/>1) We aren't good at imagining billions of instances. This was explained really well in an experiment which assessed people's ability to assign value to things. In this experiment, people were asked to put a value on a number of birds lives. The scenario was 'we want to put nets over oil ponds to stop birds from drowning in them'. What resulted was that people gave the same value to the birds, no matter how many birds there were.<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/kahneman07/kahneman07_index.html"><img alt="Image" src="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/kahneman07/images/Kahneman%20p41.jpg"/></a><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="font-weight: bold">Kahneman, one of the scientists said:</span>Basically you're representing the whole set by a prototype incident, and you evaluate the prototype incident. All the rest are like that.</div></blockquote><br/>I think that we use this same way of thinking about the repugnant conclusion.<br/>2) The word 'barely worth living' makes us think of a level of wellbeing that is actually lower than zero. It makes us think of people who are verging on killing themselves. But when someone decides to kill themselves, this is not merely a life barely worth living. It involves suicide. It's evolutionary outrage. There are checks in our system which tell us even if you are feeling down, stay alive. And so people who decide to kill themselves probably have a level of well being which is outrageously below zero. <br/>So we try to imagine lots of instances of slightly above zero happiness, but realistically, we just imagine one instance of happiness far below zero. It's no wonder we find the conclusion repugnant.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote><div><cite>RyanCarey wrote:</cite>1) We aren't good at imagining billions of instances...<br/><br/>2) The word 'barely worth living' makes us think of a level of wellbeing that is actually lower than zero. It makes us think of people who are verging on killing themselves. But when someone decides to kill themselves, this is not merely a life barely worth living. It involves suicide. It's evolutionary outrage. There are checks in our system which tell us even if you are feeling down, stay alive. And so people who decide to kill themselves probably have a level of well being which is outrageously below zero. <br/>So we try to imagine lots of instances of slightly above zero happiness, but realistically, we just imagine one instance of happiness far below zero. It's no wonder we find the conclusion repugnant.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>(sorry about delayed response, I kept forgetting this thread)<br/><br/>As you say, the net zero happiness life, if there's any such thing, is bound to be well above the point where we're so miserable we overcome our evolutionary program enough to kill ourselves. But you can't make the repugnant conclusion go away by just setting a high zero point. <br/><br/>If, for eg, we say that someone has to be consistently cheerful to be above the zero point, then we imply that anyone who isn't cheerful quite as often as we'd like would be better off not existing - ie we'd be doing them a favour by killing them.<br/><br/>Since we have powerful instrumental reasons to oppose killing people whenever they seem slightly below the zero point, that might not be such a worrying inference. But more troubling, IMO, would be the reverse repugnant conclusion. This would say, if we set the bar of 0 happiness too high, that it would be far worse for sufficiently high numbers of moderately cheerful people to exist than for a much smaller number of people to constantly suffer the worst torture you can imagine.<br/><br/>That's not necessarily a reason to reject totalising utilitarianism, but I think it should keep us from getting sanguine about the repug conclusion.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">You make a point almost as confusing as it is thought-provoking, Arepo. If I could summarise,<br/>The repugnant conclusion: It is disgusting that utilitarianism might prefer a barely above zero many to a far above zero few.<br/>The reverse repugnant conclusion: The zero is set disgustingly high. How dare we assign negative value to people who do not want to kill themselves. Population will be made to small. <br/><br/>I suppose the repugnant conclusion is harnessing the image of near-suicidal people living. Then the reverse-RC flips the whole scenario on its head. It then focusses on the idea of utilitarians enforcing happiness or killing people in their sleep against their will. How one ethical system can be demonised on the basis of two opposite false conclusions, I don't know. It almost defies belief.<br/><br/>I suppose we should enjoy the fact that the repugnant conclusion is one intuitive objection to utilitarianism in which we're accused of overvaluing life. It's almost some sort of ironic joke: <br/>Q: What's wrong with the repugnant conclusion?<br/>A: It fails to portray utilitarians as blood-sucking babykillers<br/><br/><span style="font-size: 70%; line-height: normal">I'm not sure it'll catch on</span></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

There's not really any significant difference between virtual reality and consensus reality. Folk physics works okay on both if you look at it from a more abstract point of view, but horribly on both from a less abstract point of view. In reality, there's no such thing a solid, or even a particle. There's just a bunch of entangled wave-forms. Virtual reality is designed by us, but considering we have designed so much of consensus reality that you have to drive for a while to find anything particularly natural besides the sky, and even then you have to go outside, that doesn't mean much.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

The problem is that this happiness is driven by an illusion which some find sufficient because all they want is to feed that inner psychological state, whereas as others regard this as insufficient and  need that the world has to actually change in order to evoke and justify such feelings - with the greater uncertainty that this can actually happen.

Of course they could!<br/><br/>a tangent: it reminds me of a story I read from VS Ramachandran about a man who was masochistic (he enjoyed causing himself pain). He initially used to wake up early to take cold showers but he stopped because he enjoyed it too much. Linking back to the topic at hand, I say that if these cold showers contribute to this man's wellbeing, then he should take them. If he does not, then he should not. It all depends his flourishing as a human being.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

You know in advance of entering that there are no real effects and you know that you will forget this once you have entered the machine, so that, then, you will believe they are real. The experience machine prevents you finding out that your beliefs are false - but you don't then know this - but otherwise appears as real as the real world.<br/><br/>The basic question is are experiences the be all and end all?

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1"><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>Then I'm confused.

That is this theme is a non-issue for desire fulfilment and objective preference satisfaction as models of well-being.<br/><br/>PS IMHO The far more interesting issue is evaluation-focus or act-focus, that was brought up in the Desire Utilitarianism thread and many did not seem to understand it. (I see Toby Ord is now a member here and he promotes world consequentialism which is a different take on these different evaluands.) But maybe this is for another thread.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

They usually offer some account as to why people’s alleged preference for reality ends up supporting, rather than conflicting with, their favored version of hedonism. <br/><br/>On the other hand, there are those who believe that Nozick’s thought-experiment works just fine; indeed, that the intuition it elicits demonstrates not only that hedonism is false (at least in the weak sense of revealing that pleasurable experiences are not the only thing that matter to us), but also that, should they have to choose between pleasure and reality, people would prefer the latter</div></blockquote><br/><br/>This writer argues against Nozick's experience machine by trying to beat it at its own game. He explains that our preference to stay outside Nozick's machine is partially due to a bias towards the status quo.<br/><br/>But ultimately, this passage is of limited interest to me because I don't believe in arguing against Nozick's experience machine at its own game. That is, I don't believe consulting our intuition will help us to answer philosophical questions. As useful as intuition is, I think Nozick is creating scenarios so alien to us that our intuition is not reliably pointing us in the correct direction. It's not unlike how while we can deal with the newtonian motion of a tennis ball really competently at a subconscious level, understanding quantum mechanics takes years of practice and involves more conscious and critical thinking.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Surely it is the case the some people take one option and others would the other and that is sufficient to demonstrate that hedonism is false. Whilst the sci-fi scenario is in practical somewhat terms alien to us is is sufficiently comprehensible to be useful and I cannot recall now but I have read  seen a number of real world examples which are similar to the various of the experience machine arguments whether of the Nozick, Smart or Fyfe variety. Finally I am not sure about sure about the premise of your tennis ball argument,  regardless of how you use it here, since we do not sub-consciously calculate Newtonian mechanics in playing tennis, we employ a number of heuristics and do not unconsciously solve any second order differential equations or equivalent.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Hi FG,<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Surely it is the case the some people take one option and others would the other and that is sufficient to demonstrate that hedonism is false.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I think this mini-argument is unsound, if I've understood it right. It seems to be of the form,<br/><br/>1) Hedonistic ethics imply that people always prefer to maximise their happiness.<br/>2) People don't always prefer to maximise their happiness.<br/>-&gt; Hedonistic ethics implies something false.<br/><br/>But 1) itself is false. Hedonistic ethics are normally constructed normatively, as descriptions of what people 'should' do, rather than what they actually do. Showing that they don't do it no more falsifies the claim that they should than showing that people are sometimes vicious falsifies the claim that they should be virtuous - the claims are orthogonal. <br/><br/>I also think 2) is too vague, because the concept of a preference encompasses too many things:<br/><br/>a) The act of claiming you would prefer x.<br/>b) The act of bringing x about.<br/>c) The belief that you would be more content if x were the case.<br/>d) The belief that you would be more content if you thought x were the case.<br/>e) The fact that you would be more content if x were the case.<br/>f) The fact that you would be more content if you thought x were the case.<br/><br/>And probably others too. If a form of preference ethics is based on some of these, it turns out to be a hedonistic ethic in disguise.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
