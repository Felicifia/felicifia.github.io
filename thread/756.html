Unless you're keeping the bare minimum amount of money to survive and donating the rest and spending as much time as possible promoting total well-being, you're drawing an arbitrary line. I'd definitely acknowledge that some arbitrary lines may be much better than others in terms of their consequences, though. I'm curious how each of you decide where to draw the line. How much "non-utilitarian" fun do you have? By "non-utilitarian," I mean you just do what you enjoy without worrying about whether you're promoting total well-being. Do you ever have trouble justifying having such fun?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">The demandingness objection could be used against any type of ethical ideal. You shouldn't expect utilitarianism-associating humans to be perfect utilitarians any more than you would expect Christianity-associating humans to be perfect biblical Christians. Most humans don't follow moral ideals without compromise. This shouldn't keep people away from the idea of utilitarianism <span style="font-style: italic">specifically</span>.<br/><br/>Maybe it's because utilitarians lean toward rationality, and are therefore expected to be more consistent and engage less in motivated ignorance than others.<br/><br/>But I think apart from this, the demandingness objection may be based on some overconfidence in altruistic action. Charities, even if they do efficiently what they claim to do, may have indirect rebound effects, e.g. helping the poor may reduce the motivations of others, including governments and local communities, to help the poor; handouts may decrease the motivation to work; funding research may shift funds from other sources to less valuable causes; advocating vegetarianism may lead to more wild-animal suffering, reducing existential risk may lead to many more future torture victims, and so on.<br/><br/>Given this general level of uncertainty, purchasing at least the most cost-effective ways to reduce your own suffering and create pleasure could well be utility-maximizing.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">The problem with the demandingness objection is it sees things in terms of good/evil or right/wrong with a single bright line of right at the level of "perfect utilitarian" and everything below it being terrible moral monster level.  Of course, this is a bit of a hyperbole, but instead I recommend a different view -- better/worse.<br/><br/>You're not a moral monster by any means for being at the utilitarian level you are, indeed I suspect many people here at Felicifia are a standard deviation or three above the mean.  However, we can always be "better", and that's something we can all encourage ourselves to work toward.<br/><br/>I think the demandingness objection disappears a second time around when we recognize that it really isn't all that hard to do some high impact activities, like donating a portion of income to an effective charity (or living a frugal lifestyle in order to donate more) or refraining from eating meat (or all animal products).  Many people here at Felicifia would be happy to share with those in doubt about making the lifestyle transition.<br/><br/>As for blameworthiness, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.greatplay.net">I'll be blogging</a> my own thing [s]within the week[/s] <span style="font-weight: bold">(Update: sometime in January)</span>, but I recommend reading Richard Chappell's <a class="postlink" href="http://www.philosophyetc.net/2012/04/singers-pond-and-quality-of-will.html">"Singer's Pond and Quality of Will"</a> in the meantime.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Is there such a thing as "wrong" at all, or are there just "better" and "worse"?</div></blockquote><br/>I want to say that certain things are wrong, like torturing animals because there's nothing good on TV. But failing to prevent animals from being tortured is just as bad in terms of consequences as torturing them yourself is (other things being equal). If consequences alone determine whether an action is wrong, almost everybody is acting wrongly almost most the time. That's a bit strange.<br/><br/>We could say, I'm better than most people because I eat less meat and donate more money to more-effective charities. But most people don't know what you know. They might be less open-minded, or less educated. They may live in a traditional society, and they may not enjoy the degree of freedom that we have.<br/><br/>This would be a problem for non-moral evaluation as well. A sub–three-hour marathon would have been very good for Paul Ryan, but a given for a professional. But that seems to be based mainly on our expectations. Should we call actions "right" when people act better than we expect them to, and "wrong" when they act worse?<br/><br/>Another possibility would be to call actions "wrong" when doing so maximizes the balance of happiness over suffering.<br/><br/>Or we could eschew "wrong" except when, say, communicating with children. Maybe this is equivalent to the previous option.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I suppose you could eliminate them for analytic clarity; and I've definitely advocated that, though my current pendulum has swung back to making use of them as shorthand.  So I speak of "morality" and "good"/"bad" a lot within my utilitarian framework.<br/><br/>How does desert work?  Well, I think of it mostly as a social contract -- we set up a society in which having such or such qualities or doing such and such work entitles you to a certain thing, you get that thing by virtue of having your quality.  In this case, by having the quality of malice, you are entitled to condemnation.  No wacky metaphysics required.<br/><br/>It's utilitarian too, because I think having these desert frameworks are utility maximizing for the most part.  Though I could also see why they fall short.  A good example is that of people working for income -- I think people will work harder if they think they genuinely deserve their income, but will in turn be less likely to be altruistic to the less fortunate.  Perhaps desert re-enforces unfortunate conceptions of poor people as intrinsically not worth helping?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">I have struggled this year with my charitable giving: I have pledged to give at least 50% of my pre-tax income to charity in 2012 but I saw that I could give more. Because of that I agonized over many purchases (money spent on every non-essential purchase could have gone to charity instead!). Psychologically it was taxing on me, and especially on my relationships (primarily with my girlfriend, but also with parents and friends). <br/><br/>I am drawing on a parallel between this and effectively personally promoting veganism: if you are too strict (e.g. "here's a list of 10,000+ products you should memorize and never buy again") no one will join your cause; a more lenient approach to animal product consumption will win over many more converts (and thus do more to prevent total animal suffering than staying hard-line). It's hard to know where to draw the line, but it seems almost surely to be not at the extreme end.<br/><br/>It will surely be harder to encourage others to be more utilitarian than to encourage them to be more vegan (one's a subset of the other <img alt=";)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif"/> ) but it's not impossible. I'm thinking if you can get several people a fraction of the way towards utilitarian behavior by drawing the demandingness cutoff line further away from the extreme. If you wouldn't be able to do that while being 'hardcore', it may be better to be more lax.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
