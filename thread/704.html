<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">There seem to be a lot of people out there who are familiar with utilitarianism and like it better than any other moral philosophy, but don't understand all the implications or effectively apply utilitarianism to their actions. (I shall call them "shallow utilitarians," for the fact that they have not reached any deep conclusions.)<br/><br/>I've see a number of such people on philosophy forums and the like. These people represent low-hanging fruit in terms of increasing utility: with just a little more work, they could become powerful forces for increasing utility. The question is, how do we best help them along? How do we take someone who's read a few moral dilemmas, maybe watched a few lectures on Mill, and get them to start thinking about seriously increasing utility?<br/><br/>I met such a person recently and I thought about sending him to this forum, but I expect he'd be scared off by the sorts of things we talk about, and wouldn't be likely to understand the assumptions that most of us make (e.g. animal suffering is as valuable as human suffering, you should donate as much as possible to charity, etc.). What sorts of intermediate steps might I offer him?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Here is one way to approach the problem:<br/><br/>I assert that nearly every sane person is already a utilitarian with respect to his or her self.  This is easy to see by observing what people do and do not do.  What is preferable: to push a pencil through your eye or to eat breakfast?  The answer is easy for every sane adult because every sane adult can understand the outcome and make a decision based on the outcome.<br/><br/>Where do people falter when applying utilitarianism more globally: when the beneficiary is somebody else or the benefit to the self requires consideration of a complex chain of events (like the side effects of setting a good example for others or following norms that reflect a preferred social system that benefits all).<br/><br/>There might be ways to appeal to existing instincts as a mean to pursue behavior change.  There is a field of study on attitude change, and it is used, for better or worse, by people who want to sell you something, people who want to convert you to their religion or philosophy, people who want to reduce health-risk behaviors, and so on.  You can search the Internet or a university library for 'attitude change.'  You can start here:  <a class="postlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_change">Wikipedia</a>.  If you have never studied social psychology and are interested, there is an iTunes University course for 'Sociology 150a' as <a class="postlink" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/sociology-150a-001-spring/id354825339">audio</a>  and as <a class="postlink" href="http://www.unz.org/Pub/UCBerkeleyTV-00061">video</a> (video is on iTunes too).<br/><br/>Efforts to change beliefs or behaviors might need to be targeted to the beliefs or behaviors that are antecedent to the desired outcome (in other words, address some fundamental beliefs that that need to be fixed so that people get the 'right' answer on the higher-level problem).  Some ideas:<br/><br/>* Get people to take the perspective of others (this is called 'perspective-taking' and has been studied extensively), <br/><br/>* Get people to appreciate the value of considering future outcomes (there are studies of how people vary in their consideration of consequences but I'm not sure of any attitude-change procedure for it. One measure is called the 'Consideration of Future Consequences Scale' that has been correlated with various pro-social and pro-environmental behaviors).<br/><br/>* Identify a norm that most people follow, then emphasize its importance.  One norm is to simply consider others.  No sane person pisses on the floor in the grocery store because we are considerate of others (or that is at least the reasoning that could be claimed as the norm).  The tactic of explaining what people typically do has been used to reduce alcohol consumption in universities, and I have seen billboards near me using the tactic to get people to stop chewing tobacco.<br/><br/>** another norm might be to emphasize the importance of cognitive consistency---some people simply do not care that they hold beliefs that are contradictory, and the simply avoid scrutinizing their beliefs.  They often experience a version of <a class="postlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_paradox">Moore's paradox</a> in which they might have no rebuttle to a rational argument against their belief, but they maintain that belief because they think that there must be a flaw in the rational argument even though they cannot find it.<br/><br/>** another norm to support with attitude change might be that people recognize the need to study ways to identify truth (counteracting the idea of self-evident truths).  Nobody builds an airplane without study or does any scientific work without study, yet people believe that their gut feelings can provide them with answers on complex problems like understanding the social consequences of one's actions. People have a strong tendency to believe that they understand truth when in fact they do not (sometimes leading to religious or political wars).  People are often unaware of the origins of their own behavior because the processes that control that behavior are unconscious (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810006000936">Johnson et al.</a>); they have illusions of insight, illusions of external agency, illusions of control, they are unaware of the nature of their prejudices, and so forth.  Understanding this is impeded by a 'feeling of knowing' that is not anchored to actual knowing.  At the very least, a sense of epistemological humility might help---getting people to consider that their beliefs are only tentative and not 100% factual.<br/><br/>anyway, those are some ideas.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

So if you do sincerely think it better to reach the utilitarian ideal and work toward it yourself, I think you can consider yourself a utilitarian.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ubuntu wrote:</cite>and have no interest in promoting utilitarianism.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Why not?

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Since I'm a "shallow" utilitarian, I feel I should explain myself. Let us note that recommending people to become "deep utilitarians" or effective altruists, or what we may call "act utilitarians", depends upon that this is, in fact, what utilitarianism would recommend. However, I believe that this assumption is false, and that in general, act utilitarianism leads to less total pleasure minus pain in the world than following other more efficient utilitarian decision procedures. Let me explain why.<br/><br/>First, of all, consider the following analogy to self-interested pursuit. Suppose we believe that a life with a high level of well-being is the best life to live. But once we are clear on this matter, it remains an open question how to best reach this goal. It is not self-evident that working according to the procedure "try to maximize total pleasure minus pain in your life" will actually maximize total pleasure minus pain in your life. For example, we may live better lives if we focus on our social relations and following some simple principles, such as to walk every day (even when we believe we would feel worse if walking), or to not eat sugar (even when we believe we would feel better if we ate sugar) etc. <br/><br/>Similarly, it is not self-evident that if people are act utilitarians this leads to more pleasure minus pain in the world than if people followed some other morality. Of course, it <span style="font-style: italic">might</span> still be more efficient to become an act utilitarian. But to simply assert this is not enough. We need an <span style="font-style: italic">argument</span> for why act utilitarianism is the best decision procedure.<br/><br/>Nor is it enough to point out that religious dogma, common-sense morality or other moral systems are <span style="font-style: italic">worse</span> than act utilitarianism. That other systems are worse than act utilitarianism is not in itself an argument in favor of this view. This is because there might be other systems which are <span style="font-style: italic">even better</span> than act utilitarianism.<br/><br/>Are there any reasons to think that people becoming act utilitarians leads to less total pleasure minus pain in the world? Let me suggest three such reasons:<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline">1. Coordination Problems.</span> Consider the case of a repressive dictator, where the people can overturn him only if they act together, but where if any single person demonstrates on her own, she will be killed for nothing, thereby lowering the total amount of pleasure minus pain. It would be better if everyone demonstrated and democracy was brought about, less good if everyone stayed at home, and even worse if only single individuals demonstrated. Suppose that because of surveillance and a a clamp-down on free media, the people cannot coordinate with each other. The problem is that both (a) everyone staying at home, as well as (b) everyone demonstrating, would lead the individuals to do their best they can. If everyone stays at home, then each individual has done her best. It would be true for each person that, had she gone out to demonstrate, she would have produced a worse outcome by getting killed. A whole group of act utilitarians reasoning like this might therefore come to do their best on their own, without producing the best outcome as a group.<br/><br/>The problem is not so much that a group of act utilitarians cannot reach the best outcome - they certainly <span style="font-style: italic">could have</span> done so; but rather, the problem is that a moral decision procedure which simply proclaims that we should always rebel against dictators, even if it leads to our own meaningless death, would guarantee success in this case. The conclusion: Utilitarians would in some conditions coordinate better if they were not act utilitarians.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline">2. Exploitation.</span> In an imperfect world, act-utilitarians face the threat of egoists who cooperate only when their own interests are furthered. In these cases, act utilitarians are exploited by the egoists whenever doing so furthers the interests of the egoist, while the act utilitarian will always act as to further both of their aggregate interests. If we assume that exploitation of act utilitarians will make it less likely for them to remain act-utilitarians, and that it will make it more difficult to convince others to become act utilitarians as well (perhaps because of a certain biological tendency to adopt views which make it possible for us to live decent lives), then such exploitation will over time lead to more egoists and less utilitarians. Groups of act utilitarianism might be open to what in game theory is known as "invasions" of egoists. In some cases, preserving the utilitarian ideals might therefore force us to reject act utilitarianism.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, it has been suggested that using some simple game theoretic devices, together with the assumption of an imperfect world where we have (a) a substantial number of egoists, and (b) where information about the utility of certain goods is uncertain, then many of our non-act-utilitarian institutions, such as giving less in aid to other countries and allowing gaps in the relative income between people, is actually <span style="font-style: italic">best explained by utilitarianism being true</span>. These institutions might be seen as the best possible ways in which to avoid exploitation under imperfect circumstances.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline">3. Inefficiency.</span> Even in a perfect world, it is wholly unclear why it would be more efficient to have people try to do what would be best, rather than blindly following simple principles designed on a utilitarian basis. The human brain uses up to 20% of our available energy, and even with this calculative power we struggle to make correct and rational calculations even on such matters as what to buy for dinner. We are afflicted with psyhological biases, rationalization, and research has shown that we are even less rational in our decision making than previously thought. Add to this that the challenge for calculating consequences is many times more difficult for utilitarians than for egoists, since utilitarians need to consider all the consequences for all people that will ever live, while the egoist considers merely her own life.<br/><br/>Once again, the point is not that act utilitarianism is worse than all other moral systems. It is surely not the worst moral system. But as utilitarians, we should ask ourselves, is act utilitarianism the best system? It seems likely that it is not. To give an example, a mixed system where we sometimes calculate the best consequences, and sometimes blindly follow efficient rules designed on a utilitarian basis, is most likely preferable. Exactly what such a system would look like is an interesting empirical question. But most likely, the result would not be act utilitarianism.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

But I don't think folks here are actually claiming that act utilitarianism is the best decision procedure, or the best one we know.  Rather, I think the predominant position here is closer to R. M. Hare's "<a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-level_utilitarianism">two-level utilitarianism</a>".  On this approach, there is a kind of cognitive division of labor where one spends a fraction of one's time thinking carefully (individually or collectively, as we do here on Felicifia) about what one ought to do in various circumstances and the rest of the time acting on these conclusions without thinking too much about them.  For example, instead of considering whether you should use contraception as you are about to engage in sexual intercourse, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/cost-of-kids.html">you write an essay</a> addressing this question in "the cool hour" of reflection and then act on your conclusions whenever situations of that sort arise in the future.<br/><br/>Out of curiosity, may I ask what sort of decision procedure do you yourself follow?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<h3><a href="#p7043">Re: Helping Along "Shallow" Utilitarians</a></h3>
<p class="author"><img alt="Post" height="9" src="../styles/nexus/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" title="Post" width="11"/>by <strong><a href="../user/1055.html">peterhurford</a></strong> on 2012-12-08T07:38:00</p>
<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote><div><cite>Simon Rosenqvist wrote:</cite>Once again, the point is not that act utilitarianism is worse than all other moral systems. It is surely not the worst moral system. But as utilitarians, we should ask ourselves, is act utilitarianism the best system? It seems likely that it is not.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I accept your premise that the optimal decision procedure with regard to utilitarianism is probably not trying to be an act utilitarian all the time -- in <a class="postlink" href="http://www.greatplay.net/essays/how-a-utilitarian-crosses-the-street">"How a Utilitarian Crosses The Street"</a> I agree as much and decide to use two-level utilitarianism instead.<br/><br/>However, I disagree that this premise yields the conclusion means "commonsense morality" or avoiding effective altruism is the optimal outcome.  Significant utility stands to be gained by optimal donation and/or optimal job selection, and I think the burden of proof has been met.  For example, a policy that it's totally okay for rich people to spend their millions on yachts seems hardly utility maximizing.<br/><br/>Hence, if one is motivated to actually <span style="font-style: italic">be a utilitarian</span> (follow utilitarianism as a personal lifestyle / life philosophy), I'd argue that effective altruism (or, rather, "non-shallowness") is an imperative.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
