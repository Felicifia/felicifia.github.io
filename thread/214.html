<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2">Thanks for crystallizing an issue that has occurred to me before in the context of China's economic miracle, which has resulted in a large increase in (presumably factory-farmed) meat-eating. The clash of interests seems to me to be a very important concern and I'd love to see an empirical study that examines it. For example, exactly how much has factory farming increased in China in line with its development? <br/><br/>Regarding solutions. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.vegfamcharity.org.uk/">Vegfam</a> is listed as a recommended charity on the Life You Can Save site. Their MO is development aid that doesn't exploit animals, such as irrigation and support for plant-based farming. But I'm not sure whether this kind of aid would do anything to prevent the expansion of factory farming that apparently accompanies economic development in the longer term.<br/><br/>The easiest way around this problem would be to support cost-effective humanitarian charities that have negligible impact on economic development, such as the Fred Hollows Foundation. What other example are there of these -- Red Cross/disaster relief agencies perhaps?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2"><blockquote><div><cite>Jesper Östman wrote:</cite>So saving human lives may lead to the loss of many animal lives.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>This is a very interesting point: some ways of relieving human suffering could well lead to more net animal suffering and possibly a worse world overall. I think there is some truth in this, but I'm not sure quite how it should affect our actions. I don't have time to give a full treatment of this, but I'll try to list some salient points:<br/><br/>1) If you think this, then the consequences might go much further than not helping the world's poorest people. Is spending on healthcare bad because it saves the lives of people who are most likely meat-eaters and thus probably increases the amount of factory farmed meat by a lot? Are almost all cases of saving lives like this? Is it better to let people die or even to kill them? What about your near and dear? I ask these questions because it seems that the versions of the view being proposed which are strong enough to suggest we shouldn't give to fight poverty are strong enough to have very outlandish consequences on more local issues.<br/><br/>2) People often choose to become vegetarians on the view that they don't need to cause so much suffering in order to have a meal. They thus sidestep the question of whether any net unhappiness of animals is larger than the happiness in the human meat-eater's life. This question is legitimately sidestepped because there is the option of having the life with no meat eating. However, this option is likely to be absent when talking about saving lives in developing countries, so it must be confronted.<br/><br/>3) I've looked at the ethics of eating animals quite extensively, including watching many videos of nasty factory farming techniques. I've been convinced that factory farming of animals is often *much* worse than more benign farming techniques. However, there is also the question of whether it would be better for factory farmed animals never to have lived. I think this is very probably true for battery farmed chickens, quite unclear for factory farmed chicken for meat and factory farmed pork, and not that likely for beef, dairy, duck and lamb. I'm sure others will come to their own conclusions, but these are my best guesses at the moment (and based on UK farming practice which is a bit more animal-friendly than most of Europe or Australia and quite a lot more animal-friendly than the US). I think that if the lives of the animals are worth living then the argument under consideration doesn't go through. Some people will disagree with this, but probably not utilitarians.<br/><br/>4) You could perhaps split the concern into life-saving interventions and enriching interventions, each of which leads to more factory farming in its own way. Interventions like deworming don't do much of either: they mainly remove suffering from humans and lead to better school attendance. They will have a small effect on increased lifespan and income, but will have a more beneficial ratio than many other possibilities.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2">I do think it is a very sad possibility that when the poorest and most powerless among humans get better lives this might create much more suffering among many more creatures that are even more poor and powerless.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Unexpected consequences?</span><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>If you think this, then the consequences might go much further than not helping the world's poorest people.

I ask these questions because it seems that the versions of the view being proposed which are strong enough to suggest we shouldn't give to fight poverty are strong enough to have very outlandish consequences on more local issues.<br/></div></blockquote><br/><br/>1) I hadn't thought about the possibilities of decreasing healthcare or kill to save animals lives. Surely, it seems not even the most extreme militant vegans are prepared to that. I guess some people would have been prepared to it if it had been humans that were factory farmed and then cannibalized. But consider: it doesn't seem obviously good to save the life of someone who kill humans and is prepared to do it again. In any case, from utilitarian considerations it would be a tremendously bad plan since it would be extremely contra-productive. In addition to the harm done to the humans the bad PR for the utilitarian and animal welfare movements would make it the case that far more animals would die. <br/><br/>I do make some non utilitarian prioritizations. These may include spending some resources on fun for myself, or caring about the near and dear. Some such "selfishness" may be defended on the grounds that it is psychologically very hard or impossible to avoid it. However, in the same way as I don't see a reason for favoring a fellow country-man before a poor person in the third world I neither see a reason for favoring the poor person before many suffering animals.<br/><br/>Another reason why killing wouldn't be justified is that is a high priority to ensure human survival and development. Not because humans are important as humans, but because plausibly an enlightened and technologically enhanced humanity can make the universe a much much better place. Of course, this could provide a reason for developmental aid also. If increasing welfare for the poor could lead to big enough decreases of existential risk in the long run it could be justified even if it would cost much animal suffering in the short run.<br/><br/>2) Indeed.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Hedonic level of factory farmed animals</span><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>3) I've looked at the ethics of eating animals quite extensively, including watching many videos of nasty factory farming techniques.

I think that if the lives of the animals are worth living then the argument under consideration doesn't go through. Some people will disagree with this, but probably not utilitarians.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>This is a very important and complex question. I used to eat meat myself until recently, on similar grounds. What convinced me to go (mostly) vegan was that I came to the belief that the everyday life of factory farmed animals at best would be just above the 0 hedonic level and at worst below it. If that is the case it seems very unlikely that these everyday experiences could outweigh the horrific suffering all animals would feel some part of their life (slughter etc) and some animals might feel most of their life. Of course, this reasoning depends on many empirical facts which may be different for different species of animal and farming practices.<br/><br/>A sad fact is that most of the increase in meat consumption seems to come from chicken and pork, which as you said may very well (or even probably) have lives not worth living (I'll elaborate on this in a later post). Another consideration is the point that Mattheny and Chen <a class="postlink" href="http://jgmatheny.org/matheny%20chan%202005.pdf">has made</a>, that factory farming and even ordinary farming prevents the lives of many more wild animals which arguably would have lead better lives than the farmed animals. Together I think these two points imply that factory farming cannot be justified on the ground that the farmed animals had lives worth living. However, because of utilitarian importance of the question I think an even more rigorous analysis of the topic might be needed. (Also a small point, the reply wouldn't go through for negative utilitarians.)<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Charities which won't increase factory farming</span><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>4) You could perhaps split the concern into life-saving interventions and enriching interventions, each of which leads to more factory farming in its own way.

Hopefully it should be possible to find a charity that is effective at relieving human suffering without increasing meat-consumption significantly. Information about such a charity could be very valueable to utilitarians and animal welfare people who care a lot both about the suffering of humans and of animals.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2">One would imagine that <a class="postlink" href="http://www.psi.org/">a charity based on family planning etc.</a> would dodge this problem. Although better family planning would contribute to economic prosperity, thereby contributing to animal suffering, this would be a very small effect. The much larger effect of family planning interventions on animal suffering would be by reducing population, thereby reducing the demand for meat.<br/><br/>Here is how I believe the issue must someday be approached:<br/>1) Should utilitarians sidestep the issue of how prosperity increases meat-eating by donating to animal welfare charities? Are animal welfare charities more effective than human charities by conventional measurements? If no, proceed to step 2.<br/>2) To what extent does economic prosperity (and/or health) increase consumption of meat and other animal products? If its effect is significant, proceed to step 3.<br/>3) To what extent does consumption of these animal products decrease animal wellbeing?<br/>4) Which kinds of charities are made less helpful or even harmful by considering their effects on animal wellbeing?<br/>5) Which kinds of charities are now most successful using the new and more thorough utilitarian measurement?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2">I think this is only the tip of the iceberg and without looking at the wider context is largely irrelevant.Sorry to be blunt. <br/><br/>We are living on a planet with finite resources and we are quickly approaching a point where we will be hitting a peak resource situation. People are already talking about the perfect storm of Climate Change, Peak oil and Peak General resources. <br/><br/>It has already been worked out we are using more renewable natural resources than the biosphere can generate therefore actually depleting the natural capital base. To make things worse we have created a world economy and industrial food system that is fundamentally dependent on cheap fossil fuels, allowing us to overshoot with our population by a large margin. One estimate thinks we would only be able to support less than half our current population without cheap oil. Throw in overuse and pollution of water and any thoughts of continuing to see meat and dairy as a fundamental part of anyone’s diet-given their water intensity- isn’t dealing with the reality of the situation. <br/><br/>This brings up fundamental questions concerning the ethics of finite resources, not only about sharing resources between humans, but between us and other species as well. What justification does humanity have to dominate - oftento the point of extinction-the consumption of the world’s resources? What ethical justification can have some people consuming more than their needs while others cannot even satisfy their needs. There are so many issues like this that don’t seem to be on the radar.<br/><br/>So unfortunately IMO talking about the “The poor meat eater problem” or even ‘The Drowning Child’, totally fails to comprehend the bigger picture or the huge mess we are in. More like rearranging the chairs on the Titanic.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2">It is reassuring to hear sensible debate about whether saving human lives increases suffering in the world.<br/>     However, I do wonder why it need be asked whether it is better to have lived at all than to have never lived.  If an organism has never lived, will it know what it is missing?  I doubt it.  So there is no such organism to feel sorry for.  Don't we get pleasure from looking at the moon through its tranquility?  Isn't it beautiful to think that there is no suffering there?  I don't think we should give to Oxfam and the like to increase the amount of non-human animals that are bred.  The fewer non-humans that live the better, or at least the lesser harm.  Furthermore, humans often breed through philosophical choice, implying that for many of us at least up to a point in our lives, we find our own lives worth living and are happy to vicariously multiply our experience by having kids.  We have no evidence to suggest that non-human animals breed through philosophical choice.  What is there to suggest that their lives are worth living even at the best of times?  I think that negative utilitarianism for non-human animals is the best policy.  I also think that for humans it is the best policy, but that is another discussion.<br/>    Also, I believe that since each human will die anyway, charities that 'save' lives might increase human suffering since they lengthen the person's life, during which the person will suffer more, and then will die a more or less agonising death than that which was postponed by the charity.  As this post has pointed out, if you add to that the suffering caused by the person's consumption of hypersensitive non-human animals then human 'life-saving' charities do cause more suffering.<br/>    Finally, one of my compassionate fellow Felicifia commentators implied that there is a danger that if we condone the deaths of for example starving Africans, then there is a danger that that condoning might lead us to condone murdering humans to decrease suffering.  That is a slippery slope argument.  Even if murdering humans is morally wrong, it doesn't necessarily make not giving to a human saving charity morally wrong.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2">Hi Daniel,<br/><br/>thanks for your reply to my comment.<br/>You mentioned the difficult in quantifying the total 'sum' (not your word, Daniel, mine for want of a better one) of positive or negative utility in the lives of others.  But need we try to work out whether they would experience more pleasure than pain to justify not letting them be born?  From memory I will outline at leasst the gist of a point that Peter Singer raised with which I agree.  He was responding to an argument from people who condoned factory farming (or perhaps animal testing or both, I can't remember which).  Their argument was that it was better to have lived than to have never lived at all.  Peter Singer's rebuttal was that in centuries to come, when it becomes possible to through scientific procedures breed humans and other animals from matter around us, we will see the absurdity of the 'it is better to have lived than not at all' argument.  He asked how much non-sentient matter will these people be trying to 'save' into becoming sentient beings.<br/>   I think Singer has some great points.  But to be honest, I think that although he calls expresses his views as utilitarian, I believe that they are better described as negative utilitarian.  Richard Ryder criticised Singer's utilitarianism, saying that it could justify the gang rape of a woman, providing that the rape gave enough pleasure to the gang.  While I don't know enough about Singer's utilitarianism to say whether it can justify gang rape, I do believe that because utilitarianism and greater good thinking can in certain forms justify the torturous lives and agonising deaths of the millions or perhaps billions of the more abused farm animals (and not just factory farmed ones, read Tolstoy's essay on Carnivorism if you doubt this), I believe that negative utilitarianism is a more compassionate policy.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2">The gang rape example seems biased. I don't know how bad it is, but it's said that it's worse than death. I don't expect ethical thought experiments to be perfect, but when you're assuming a difference of orders of magnitude from what's accurate, I think that will bias the response a bit. People will emotionally respond to that example based on how it would be in real life, not in a universe where it's just a bad day for the girl.<br/><br/>By the same token, you can justify torturing animals, if you assume they're not being tortured as much as they are. If you want to avoid it, just try and find out how the animals really feel. Don't assume they can't feel happiness.<br/><br/>Would you let me pinch you for a million dollars? If so, you probably think your own happiness can outweigh your own pain. Why wouldn't this be true in general?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2">Hi Richard,<br/><br/>it seems like you favour negative utilitarianism because it allows you to condemn factory farming. Traditional classical utilitarianism can allow you to condemn factory farming too. You just need to have a concept of life that is worse than not living at all. That is, you need to say that once life becomes sufficiently painful, its utility is negative. Then, you can say that the life of a factory-farmed cow or chicken is this sort of negative utility life. i.e. it would be better for these lives not to have existed in the first place.<br/><br/>It seems dubious that classical utilitarianism could support gang rape. Clearly the victim would experience suffering that could last for many years whereas the perpitrators would experience a pleasure that is not as great or long-lasting.<br/><br/>While your objections to classical utilitarianism seem easily managed, I think the age-old objection to negative utilitarianism runs deeper. If all that matters is the abolition of suffering, then the abolition of experience is desirable. We shouldn't just prevent factory-farmed animals from having lived. We should prevent all experience, even a life like yours or mine whose pleasure outweighs its suffering.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="4">Young Ryan, my life's pleasure outweighs its pain?  Young Sir.  How optimistic of you.  Shouldn't I decide whether my pleasure outweighs my pain?<br/>Furthermore, you have exceeded the limits of your knowledge when you say that your life's pleasure outweighs its pain.  Outside of your infant years, most of which you cannot remember, you have only experienced the easiest years of your life. Dear Ryan, I am sorry to remind such a cheery soul that a person's likelihood of suffering emotional distress increases with age.  Although your comedy will be the better for it, you will become more of a Woody Allen in your thirties, possibly because of the increase in size of the pre-frontal lobes.  Maybe I am too Woodylike already at a tender 36 years old to evaluate the evidence free of pessimism, so I won't debunk the downhill slump into old age here.<br/>Just to add though, I agree with Schopenhauer, when he says, 'What is life but a uselessly disturbing episode in the blissful repose of nothingness.'  I wish I had been consulted on whether I should be born.  I would rather go to sleep, but here I go, pushing through life's maze, too scared of the road to the dark side to take it, even though it offers a bumpy journey to a big sleep.<br/>You spoke of problems with negative utilitarianism, but since it is a theory of lesser harm, if it is done correctly, it is less problematic than utilitarianism.  In increasing lives, we increase problems.  To illustrate, in an essay whose name I cannot remember, Nick Bostrom celebrates his wish that the human population will increase.  He complained that he had friends and colleagues who would be contented with the prospect of the human race ending.  He says that he perceives as an incongruence in their thinking, pointing out that these friends of his would all be happy for their being fewer humans, and yet they feel deep sympathy for a child crying.  But it is Bostrom's idea which is incongruent.  If there are more people in the world, there will be more children crying.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="4">Jesper Ostman says this at the start of this website's 'Poor Meat-Eater Problem' discussion:<br/><br/>'A somewhat disturbing problem is that there may be a direct conflict between saving poor humans and caring about the welfare of animals....  Rather the problem is that (according to Gaverick, in conversation) better health and thus wealth among the poor increases their meat eating. So saving human lives may lead to the loss of many animal lives'.<br/>      Jesper, you point out that helping the poor in developing countries will probably increase their meat-eating, and you correctly imply that meat-eating is morally undesirable?  But since meat-eating is morally undesirable, do you agree that it is also immoral to help the wealthy, for example by giving to cancer charities, and thus perpetuate their meat-eating?  For you question whether the lives of the poor whose deaths might be postponed by western charity will be worth the suffering they cause in factory farms.  So, do you also question whether the lives of those who are already wealthy are worth the suffering that they cause livestock?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="4">Thank you for your reply, Jesper.<br/>      your last comment proposed a well thought out point about contributing to charities for the wealthy.<br/>      Regarding your comment on age and happiness, I am still unsure what to make of the conflicting or at least paradoxical studies and evidence.  I have just also read the results of a study that concluded that up to a certain point people become more happy as they age.  Here is the study:<br/><br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.euro.centre.org/data/1207216181_14636.pdf">http://www.euro.centre.org/data/1207216181_14636.pdf</a><br/><br/>Nevertheless, the study's found that students are generally happier than those in employment.<br/>Furthermore, 'Affluenza' and 'Britain on the Couch' by Oliver James and 'Depression'  by Dorothy Rowe, all support the (if they are right, paradoxical) evidence that emotional distress is more common in older people.  Perhaps, the essay whose link is above paradoxically supports the finding that emotional distress occurs more frequently as people age.  It says that there is greater unhappiness among people (other than students and the more wealthy, who the study says are both exceptions) who are of employment age.  The study also finds that after the initial rosy pensioners period, there is a more difficult old age period.  One study cited in the Guardian stated that people were most likely to be unhappy in their 50s.  (By the by, I contend that young students are happier than your average person and unless they are to become uncommonly wealthy, they will have lived only through one of the happiest times of their lives, which is not far off the point I made to Ryan.  )</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="4">The survey used for the study above, however, used the question 'On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being low and 10 being high, how do you rate your quality of life.'  That was the study's only means of testing its subjects.  Its answers, therefore, must be read with scepticism, because when people answer survey questions, they have been shown to answer differently from what they really believe.  This difference between what the subjects say they prefer and what they really prefer has been illuminated by showing that when a person's preferences can be measured by his or her actions, that person often acts in a way that does not correspond with his or her stated preferences.  <br/>     Furthermore, from personal experience, the people who I know in their 60s appear to be quite neurotic and prone to anxiety (one friend of mine has been diagnosed with anxiety at 65, and is facing the most challenging period of his life, after having lived a generally emotionally placid prior adulthood).<br/>      To reiterate, if we evaluate the utility of human life in order to weigh it against the burden of non-human suffering that we generate, we must bear in mind that we have not yet lived through our darkest times as individuals, and if we must weigh up the good and bad in each human life, we must discount signifantly for the downturn in our later years.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="4">Hi Daniel,<br/><br/>it is not that you should take my word for it.  Nor must you take the survey's.  But since there are plenty of people in their 60s to observe and speak to, if you get to know enough of them from a borad social background, you might observe for yourself that their anxiety and emotional distress levels are higher than those of people in their 20s.  Furthermore, if you do not have access to many people in their 60s, you still don't have to take my word or the survey's word.  Review the evidence documented by psychologists.  Although I am underread on psychology, the few works on emotional distress I have read ('Affluenza' and 'Britain on the Couch' by Oliver James and 'Depression' by Dorothy Rowe) state that people are more prone to emotional distress as they become older.<br/>Finally, the study I read angled the conclusion to say that people get happier in their old age.  But is that really the conclusion one ought to draw from that study?  For it finds that after school, on average, people become unhappier, with their peak unhappiness in their 50s, then the happiest time of their lives in their 60s, before another rise in their unhappiness levels that before they die.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="4">Who said I completely distrust surveys?   I do not completely distrust surveys.<br/>Nevertheless, when a survey's evidence conflicts with evidence that I have observed then I must doubt that survey.  Furthermore, the books that I mention above state that people are more prone to emotional distress as they age.  If their evidence is from a survey, one would imagine that if their personal experience with patients contradicted that evidence, they would also doubt the survey.  But I did not think that they did get that information from a survey.  I would have to browse through the books again to be sure, but I remember for some reason thinking that they had concluded this from the demographic of the patients they treat and the severity of those patients' condition.  Also, none of the case studies of depressed people in their books were of people in their twenties.<br/>       Also, from the report whose link Jesper just provided, the following passage chimes with my experience:<br/><br/>"As people get older, they're more aware of mortality," Carstensen said. "So when they see or experience moments of wonderful things, that often comes with the realization that life is fragile and will come to an end."<br/><br/>Classic anhedonia.  The author then writes:  "But that's a good thing. It's a signal of strong emotional health and balance."  What?  Thinking about death when you experience something wonderful is a good thing?  From my experience, things that made me feel rapture and bliss when I was young often make me feel mild pleasure compared to the all consuming thrill that they used to give me.  I wish that anhedonia were a good thing.  <br/>     While I am swayed somewhat by the survey, I have my doubts from my experience, and because of the above statement's evidence of anhedonia.  Also, because it seems contradictory to my personal experience, and perhaps to one's instincts, one must look at the motivation behind the article.  Doesn't its conclusion make an interesting paradox?  'People get happier as they get older.'  Isn't that paradox more intriguing than an article headlined: 'People get unhappier as they get older'?  <br/>Furthermore, don't we instinctively assume that we will experience less happiness as we age?  For anyone who is normally sociable, wouldn't it be unusual if, despite our twenty years plus of speaking to and seeing people of a broad demographic, these years of intuition based on interpersonal experience were wrong?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="4">Dambisa Moyo believes that Western aid to African countries prevents Africans from developing their own local economies and, in the long run, further increases poverty and the need for aid to begin with. The idea of letting people starve is not something I can easily swallow but there's no doubt in my mind that it would be justified if it prevented even more suffering than it caused (or allowed, rather). Whether or not it would, I don't know. Whether or not there is a way to eliminate both human poverty and factory farming, I don't know. I will (at least when I have an income) donate to human charities as well as continue to live a vegan lifestyle (to the best of my ability) until I'm convinced that raising the standard of living for people in third world countries would lead to more suffering then it would alleviate. Global warming is also a big issue, we would need 6(?) Earths to sustain us as it is and around 80% (?) of all humans currently live on a dollar a day, imagine how much bigger our collective carbon footprint would be if everyone lived the way that Westerners do. It's <span style="font-style: italic">frightening</span>.<br/><br/>I'm troubled by the idea that painlessly killing non-human animals is acceptable if it increases more pleasure than it prevents but I suppose it can be justified, anyone who considers themselves to be a hedonist has to be consistent and regard non-human happiness as being equally as valuable as human happiness, if killing non-human animals for food is acceptable than killing humans for food, at least in similar circumstances (like the human not realizing he or she will be killed) must also be acceptable. At least in theory, in practice, killing non-human animals for food always involves some suffering and I don't believe that any amount of happiness can make up for intolerable stress. Whether or not my views can be classified as negative utilitarian, I don't know.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Would you let me pinch you for a million dollars?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I would let you do it, if not because having a million dollars would cause me a great deal of pleasure then because it would eliminate a great deal of stress. I wouldn't have to worry about finding another job, I wouldn't have to worry about paying for food or shelter, it would provide me with a lot of entertainment that would not only be intrinsically valuable but instrumentally valuable in preventing me from becoming bored etc. <br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Why wouldn't this be true in general?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I don't deny that happiness is intrinsically good or that maximizing happiness for it's own sake is ethical but I view maximizing happiness as supererogatory. Only minimizing distress is morally *urgent*. From a hedonist point of view, death (or being unconscious) is of neutral value, since there is neither happiness or suffering in death. If this is true, then isn't it implied that it wasn't really *necessary* for any of us to have come into existence? It's better to be happy than it is to be unconscious/non-existent, yes, but there's nothing wrong with not existing/being unconscious/dead so avoiding harm should take priority over experiencing happiness.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

We seem to be in more agreement than I first thought.  <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/> <br/><br/>Well, another common "intuitive" idea is that thinking of death makes us appreciate life a lot more than we otherwise would (a common argument against life-extension is based on this, the proponents roughly say that without death we could never feel any happiness)...  As with other intuitive ideas I believe they shouldn't be given too much weight unless they are supported by systematic scientific investigation. <br/><br/>One way to explain away the contra-intuitiveness of the thought that people should get happier as they get older is that we typically believe happiness is strongly correlated with things like health, status, beauty and wealth which decline when we get old. However, just about all happiness research has disconfirmed that happiness correlates strongly with any of these variables.<br/><br/>Also, note the psychology studies on neuroticism, eg, which say that people become less neurotic as they grow older:<br/>Srivastava, S., John, O.

Here's what I'm trying to say.  Even for those of us who have grown up in abusive families and/or those of us have been treated as outcasts at 'schools.'  And the standard 'school' is such a nonfunctioning institution that having intense intellectual interests, as many people interested in philosophy do, is often enough to get you labelled as 'different' and that is often enough to get you treated poorly.  Now, combine that with good descriptive art such as SCHINDLER'S LIST (either the book or the movie) and a person might feel he or she has a pretty good idea just how bad a concentration camp is.  Still, to be on the cautious side, let's add 30%.  That's what I'm saying.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="4">What humans need is not assistance in growing their numbers until the earth can support not a single human more, but assistance in understanding what will happen to the planet if humans fail to learn how to control their reproduction.  I'll start with the assumption that humans will continue on their current course such that population will rise to the point where all arable land is farmed, all the easy-to-get resources will be gone, habitats will be destroyed, and the combination of overcrowding and cyclical periods of starvation will contribute to mass suffering and wide-spread civil unrest. It follows that any assistance to help a carnivorous people to thrive will work toward both animal suffering and a future state of enduring endemic human suffering. Helping poor people to prevent their deaths contributes toward this end (e.g., give them free rice and they will have more money for meat and will make more carnivorous babies), but alleviating the suffering from non-life threatening conditions does not. For example, providing pain killers (e.g., aspirin), fixing broken legs, and distributing eye glasses seem like worthy causes with few adverse side-effects. Teaching people about family planning and educating women so that they can take control of their reproductive ability seem OK. <br/><br/>It might seem as though helping senior citizens in poor countries would reduce human suffering without the side-effect of increasing the base of sufferers, but if that assistance allows younger people to thrive or eat meat (due to not having to support grandpa), then the vegetarian utilitarian might be causing harm. Maybe feeding poor senior citizens good, vegetarian meals can help a utilitarian reduce the suffering of others and reduce criticisms of friends who call you a cold-hearted cheap-skate.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Yeah, SnowLeopard, your moderate negative utilitarianism doesn't sound too radical. The way you weakly phrase it - being in a concentration camp is worse than it appears from a distance - is something I strongly agree with. I think most people agree that intense suffering is hard to imagine without having experienced it before. Whether the same is true for happiness is an interesting question.<br/><br/>And re your latest point - educating women seems to effectively reduce population growth - I think this is correct. Bombing an overpopulated section might reduce population. It might even do it cheaply. But would this prevent more suffering than it causes? No. Would this even cause population to be depressed over the long term? Who knows. This is not effective in any utilitarian sense.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">One way to solve the dilemma could be to donate to research and/or create political support for research that aims at creating animal products (or fully competitive substitutes) without creating suffering brains as a by-product. In-Vitro meat and artificial diary products/eggs/etc. could be one solution. Creating animals that cannot suffer would be another potential solution. Ideally, these production methods should be cheaper and more resource-efficient, and they should be applicable by developing countries and their local economies themselves.<br/><br/>I would also further investigate the assumption that factory-farmed animals are suffering more than locally farmed animals; it seems like this could strongly depend on implementation details of these systems. For instance, manual slaughter by unprofessionals could create more suffering on average than modern industrialized slaughter routines. I would intuitively expect the lives of animals in both types of systems to be net-negative, however.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

These are big numbers, of course. But how many farm animals are there? This is a difficult question, partly because animals are killed systematically. We have some data anyway. 58 billion of mammalian and birds were killed in 2007. This data doesn't include fish.<br/><br/><a class="postlink" href="http://masalladelaespecie.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/faostat071.jpg">http://masalladelaespecie.files.wordpre ... tat071.jpg</a><br/><br/>(Data can be obtained here: <a class="postlink" href="http://faostat.fao.org/site/569/default.aspx#ancor">http://faostat.fao.org/site/569/default.aspx#ancor</a> )<br/><br/>Most of these animals have extreme suffering in their life. It's a bad thing that humans feel hungry, fall ill and so on. But it's a very worse thing what most of animals suffer in farms. I guess what most of animals suffer is equivalent to what tortured humans suffer.<br/><br/>Moreover, we can help a lot of more animals than humans with the same money. See: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/dollar-worth.pdf">http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/dollar-worth.pdf</a><br/><br/>In short:<br/><br/>- There are a lot of more farm animals than poor humans.<br/>- Most of farm animals suffer more than poor humans.<br/>- To increase meat consumption among the poor will lead to increase animal suffering.<br/>- We will avoid a lot of more suffering if we support to animal charities.<br/><br/>We can avoid a lot of more suffering if we support animal charities, and I think this it's pretty clear. There are utilitarians who give a lot of importance to the existential-risk issue. I understand their points, although I prefer to put my efforts promoting the anti-speciesist meme (this issue would deserve a different message).

In-vitro meat will have an initial yuck factor, but if it can be made cheaper\more resource-efficient than ordinary meat, it might gain substantial market shares rather quickly. I can't really see China forfeit any significant consumption out of animal welfare considerations, but if in-vitro meat is competitive, they may adopt it more readily than, say, Europe.<br/><br/>My point about side-effect mostly was aimed at the potential sustainability increase of such technologies, which will in turn decrease existential risk, which will significantly increase the expected value of total suffering in the future universe. Even if you prefer total util over neg util considerations, you're still in danger of creating massive disutility if a large-scale dystopic scenario materializes later. Investments in empirical refinement of the most relevant priors to this question seem most promising. If you don't know which way is the right one, investing time in order to find that out may be far better spent than covering ground in any given direction, even if you have a gut feeling what the right direction is.<br/><br/>For example, it might make sense to do more research to understand how minds in general work, what the fundamental limits or possibilities of hedonic advancements are, how much alien wildlife there probably is etc. Then decide whether existential risk is probably good or probably bad, only then invest money strategically. Unless you're convinced that there is no realistic way to spend time/money to better model the big picture, and therefore turn to more local utility.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div><blockquote class="uncited"><div>As for inefficient, I once donated to a hard-sell animal protection charity whose founder ended up in jail because he used the donations to buy a boat for himself.</div></blockquote><br/>Do you think that you can read so much into a single anecdote?</div></blockquote><br/>No, and the fact that he was successfully convicted actually exemplifies that correction mechanims against open fraud do work. Nevertheless, accountability and controlling of charities are relevant for expected utility considerations. In the case of New Harvest, I would have liked some online resources on how many donations they get and which research projects are funded with how much money.

You have a good point here. On the other hand, I'm concerned about suffering in a world where humans don't take animal interests into account, and for that reason I promote charities that promote moral consideration of (domestic and wild) animals. This increases the possibility of a world with less suffering in any case.<br/><br/>I agree that there are a lot of inefficient animal-rights charities though. My ideal one is a hedonist anti-speciesist and highly philosophical "animal rights" charity, what doesn't exist for now. I prefer to save my money basically at this moment, although I'm an activist of several animal-rights in my free time -- I think they make a good job.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

It would indeed be valuable to "to do more research to understand how minds in general work, what the fundamental limits or possibilities of hedonic advancements are, how much alien wildlife there probably is etc." However, it's not obvious that existential risk is the key factor we should target.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">I'm basically agreed on the whole "more research on existential risk badness front", especially as I had previously thought all increases were bad but am now having to re think (due to torture scenarios, terraforming making massive wild animal suffering, lab-universes etc. I've updated to 80% probability that x-risks are bad)<br/><br/>Just to chip in with another factor that has been mentioned only briefly, I'm concerned about the impact of any utilitarian project on wild animal suffering. This seems of overriding importance given large numbers of wild animal suffering (especially as I assign probability of ~25% to insect suffering and there are ~10*17 insects around).<br/><br/>To bring things back to the basic question of aid to poor humans increasing factory farmed animals, the question seems to be whether this increases or decreases the number of wild animals around, as the wild animals seem to outweigh the factory farmed animals (in number if not in intensity of suffering). I am inclined to think that a greater human population would be likely to reduce wild animal population and increases in meat consumption would do this as well. The likely effect of aid then seems to be in a positive direction, if my assumptions hold true. However, there is still the problem of existential risk being bad and increased environmental damage (which is what my argument counts on) causing an increase in existential risk.<br/><br/>And of course we might still do best to do as Alan suggests and try to increase understanding of wild animal suffering.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

"Happy farming" I'll take to mean "free-range", and that would certainly use more resources than factory farming, e.g. more food needs to be grown to be fed to the animals. In this case, we would expect animal lives in general to be reduced in number, leading to better outcomes overall.<br/><br/>But I'm not sure about this conclusion. We might do better in the long run if we discouraged speciesism in general, promoting free-range stuff doesn't seem to do this as strongly as promoting veganism. So there's that, and Alan also argued <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/veg-and-wild-animals.html">here</a> that we might want to think about global warming as well, if it leads to more wild animal suffering in the long term, then we would do well to try and stop it, and veganism would be better than free-range farming at doing that.<br/><br/>And yeah, this doesn't take x-risks into account at all, and those could potentially be the most important in the long run.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="3">Once again, Gedusa has beat me to the punch on my reply. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/><br/><br/>Yes, "happy farming" might very well be better than veganism. But the main point of Vegan Outreach is, as Gedusa suggests, to reduce speciesism. Most "happy farming" efforts tend to be at the level of targeting producers or governments. I doubt an organization would have as much success handing out brochures encouraging people to buy happy meat, mainly because it's expensive and very hard to find! If promoting vegetarianism is even 1% better at combating speciesism than promoting happy farming, then I'd prefer to promote vegetarianism.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

He actually typed an email back. Rereading my letter now, I sometimes wonder whether I've learned anything new since the first few months after I discovered utilitarianism during ~June 2005. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/> (Answer: Yes, but with rapid diminishment in marginal wisdom.)<br/><br/>BTW, for the record, I don't now agree with everything in this paragraph on page 4 of my letter:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>As before, it would not be a good idea to publicly proclaim concern for insect pain as part of animal liberation, inasmuch as doing so would make the movement appear to hold crazy and impossible goals. [...] Even if insects are sentient, I find the promotion of veganism still to be one of the most effectual ways to reduce suffering, since the raising of animals requires the cultivation of far more grain (and the accompanying use of far more pesticides) than direct growing of plants for human consumption.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>I think it is good to talk openly about the possibility of insect suffering among the right audiences. If we don't do it, will anyone do it, or will the issue get lost? Considering that insects may dominate all larger animals in their extent of suffering, the issue seems to big to ignore. I also don't know whether pesticide use is net good or net bad, considering that it does reduce insect populations on crop land in the short run. I suspect crop production might still be net bad for insects, but maybe the stronger argument is that crop production is an efficient way to convert sunlight into food, and more food means more suffering animals that can come into existence.<br/><br/>As far as this line: "I still consider the weighted-average expected value for the change in utility that results from [...] preservation of the environment to be very positive," my change of sentiments since 2005 is more clear (depending on what kind of environmental preservation we're talking about).</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="9">Thanks for sharing, Brian!  I wonder specifically about the effect of extreme poverty reduction also leading to a reduction in population, and how that effects the tilt of the problem.  I also wonder if you could have persuaded Singer not based on the poor meat-eater problem, but based on the calculated cost-effectiveness of Vegan Outreach alone.<br/><br/>Though I suspect that since Singer is such a public figure, his biggest impact is in persuading others to donate, and thus needs a cause that can be put forth with a public face.  Right now, I think converting people from donating more or less randomly without concern to effectiveness to GiveWell top charities is a bold and likely step in the right direction, whereas convincing the population at large to start donating to Vegan Outreach seems much less likely to work.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I think animals are sufficiently more important in quantitative terms than humans that it would be worth the reduced audience. But I can see your point.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>LadyMorgana wrote:</cite>I think a relevant difference here might be that Singer is a moral realist (I think?) and so has more faith in the arc of history bending towards utilitarianism<br/></div></blockquote><br/>As Peter observed, it's hard to say. On the one hand, he <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1995----.htm">has written</a>, "I am not defending the objectivity of ethics in the traditional sense. Ethical truths are not written into the fabric of the universe: to that extent the subjectivist is correct." But then he goes on to say:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>On the other hand, once there are beings with desires, there are values that are not only the subjective values of each individual being. The possibility of being led, by reasoning, to the point of view of the universe provides as much "objectivity" as there can be. When my ability to reason shows me that the suffering of another being is very similar to my own suffering and (in an appropriate case) matters just as much to that other being as my own suffering matters to me, then my reason is showing me something that is undeniably <span style="font-style: italic">true</span>.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>I don't know how this falls out in terms of his optimism about the future.<br/><br/>I'm not a moral realist, but even if I were, I would still be worried. Who's to say that future humans will follow the moral truth? Certainly many human actions in the past haven't been consistent with the moral truth. Moreover, it may not even be humans who control the future. Most likely, the future will slip out of our hands and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/fut/evolution.html">be dominated by some other force that outcompetes us</a>. This doesn't seem to bode well for moral progress.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>peterhurford wrote:</cite>I could think of a few reasons, but I'm interested to hear why you think that.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Reduced climate change, more food availability, etc.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

If the poor meat-eater problem is indeed valid, then donating to effective human charities is worse than donating to ineffective charities. Furthermore, effective altruists do not seem particularly inclined to care about animal suffering. (A lot of utilitarians care about effectively preventing animal suffering, but there's a confounding variable there.) It might be worthwhile to encourage effective altruism if that made them more likely also to care about animal suffering, but this does not appear to be the case.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

How do marketers for Bing measure their success? By people reached, traffic to the website, opinion surveys, etc. We can do basically the same things here.<br/>----<br/><br/>Now, granted, these are just subgoals, and I think your point is that even if we achieve these subgoals, it doesn't mean we've succeeded in the long term at changing political policies around WAS [wild-animal suffering] 200 years down the road.<br/><br/>We can be creative and aim to come up with better metrics. But even in the worst case, where we don't find better metrics, the expected-value argument won't go away.

Consider something like gay rights. By now, it's pretty darn certain that a future friendly AI is not going to be significantly prejudiced against gays. That's because elite culture has so absorbed the idea of gay tolerance that it becomes like breathing. If we can do something similar for the notion that wild-animal suffering is no more tolerable than human suffering from malaria or starvation, we'll be in a better position.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Essentially, preference utilitarianism from a moral realism point of view says there is real, intrinsic value in satisfying preferences.  However, preference should not be confused with this kind of realist value.  As soon as you stop preferring the tree to exist, you stop having that preference, yes.  But your preference satisfaction would still be of intrinsic value, and the tree would too, in so far as you prefer it to be there.<br/><br/>I'm not a realist, but preference utilitarianism is compatible with realism.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="7">That's a circular reasoning. You give more weight to a human because is a human.<br/><br/>Some speciesists try to argue their position appealing to intelligence, emotional lives, relationships or another attributes. It seems that you think it's an axiom that any human is more important than any non-human animal.<br/><br/>I cannot accept that, and I think it's not compatible with a mental state nor a preferentialist theory of value.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="7">Fair enough. However, I do lean pretty close to utilitarianism.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="7">I wonder how the cultural development of speciesism was affected by the historical happenstance that we're the only human species still around.<br/><br/>Imagine a modern world in which Homo floresiensis and Homo erectus lived side by side with Homo sapiens.

Maybe speciesism would have been seen simply as a stronger form of racism.<br/><br/>How ironic that other -isms have been fought with references to our common humanity: <span style="font-style: italic">They are human too.</span> Unfortunately, you can't do that with gorillas.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
