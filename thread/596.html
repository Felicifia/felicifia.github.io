<h3><a href="#p5200">Utilitarianism, feminism and the assumption of male privileg</a></h3>
<p class="author"><img alt="Post" height="9" src="../styles/nexus/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" title="Post" width="11"/>by <strong><a href="../user/286.html">Ubuntu</a></strong> on 2012-04-05T21:03:00</p>
<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Utilitarians may differ to the extent on how serious of a problem they think discrimination against men (or Whites or any other group that is or is perceived as being traditionally 'privileged') actually is but all utilitarians have to concede, as descriptive egalitarians, that female interests matter no more or less than male interests do and, as prescriptive egalitarians, that female interests shouldn't be given any more or less consideration that male interests should. I bring this up (and I'm writing this quickly) because I don't think I've ever heard utilitarian commentary on sex based double standards as they negatively effect men while discrimination against women is widely accepted and sympathized with, for the most part. There's actually good evidence that we have an instinctive gender empathy gap that is coded into our DNA and encouraged through socialization (ie. violence against men is completely normalized, the effect of objectification on men is usually dismissed simply because male objectification is usually dependent on traits that indicate social status,confidence, aggression etc. as opposed to appearance alone), people from all cultures are overwhelmingly more comfortable with the suffering and death of men as opposed to the suffering and death of women (the women and children first mentality). There's an assumption of male privilege among most people who identify as feminists that, arguably, isn't actually supported by empirical evidence. From another site: <br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Green - Advantaged/privileged<br/>Red - Disadvantaged/unprivileged<br/>Unsheltered Homeless (2009) [1]<br/>Women – 12,000 – 4%<br/>Men – 240,000 – 96%<br/>Life Expectancy (2006) [2]<br/>Women – 80.8 Years<br/>Men – 75.7 Years<br/>Suicides (2008) [3]<br/>Women – 7,585 - 19%<br/>Men – 28,450 - 81%<br/>Deaths by Homicide (2004) [4]<br/>Women – 3,856 – 20%<br/>Men – 14,717 – 80%<br/>Deaths from Cancer (2004) [4]<br/>Women – 269,819<br/>Men – 290,069<br/>Deaths from HIV/AIDS (2004) [4]<br/>Women – 3,357<br/>Men – 8,756<br/>Federal Funds for Sex Specific Cancer Research [5]<br/>Women – Breast Cancer – $631,000,000 - 40,000 Deaths<br/>Men – Prostate Cancer – $300,000,000 - 33,000 Deaths<br/>Deaths on the Job (2010) [6]<br/>Women – 355 - 7%<br/>Men – 4,192 - 93%<br/>Injuries on the Job (2007) [10]<br/>Women – 36%<br/>Men – 64%<br/>College Enrollment (2009) [7]<br/>Women – 58% - 11,658,000<br/>Men – 42% - 8,770,000<br/>Affirmative Action Education Programs (Gender Specific) [8]<br/>Women – Yes<br/>Men – No<br/>Unemployment Rates (2010) [9]<br/>Women – 8.6% – 6,199,000<br/>Men – 10.5% - 8,626,000<br/>Average Hours Worked Per Week (2010) [11]<br/>Women – 36.1<br/>Men – 40.2<br/>High School Graduation Rates (2005) [12]<br/>Women – 72%<br/>Men – 65%<br/>Incarceration Rates (2009) [13]<br/>Women – 114,979 - 7%<br/>Men – 1,502,49 - 93%<br/>Child Custody Rates [14]<br/>Women – 11,268,000 custodial mothers<br/>Men – 2,907,000 custodial fathers<br/>US Military Deaths From 1950 – 2010 [15][16][17]<br/>Women – 139 - 0.001%<br/>Men – 100,063 - 99.99%<br/>Federally Funded Battered Shelters [18]<br/>Women – 2,000+ $300,000,000 per year<br/>Men – None – $0<br/>Federally Funded Health Offices and Research 1970 – Present (not including cancer research)[19]<br/>Women Only – Office, Projects and Programs 70+ – Funds – $100,000,000,000<br/>Men Only – None – $0<br/>Forced Selective Service<br/>Women – No<br/>Men – Yes<br/>Drug and Alcohol Addiction and Abuse Rates (2010) [20]<br/>Women – 5.8%<br/>Men – 12.2%</div></blockquote><br/><br/>In addition to this, studies have shown that while male infants cry and fuss more than female infants do, female infants are significantly more likely to be nurtured and comforted. A double blind study involving male and female high school students showed that, even when work is identical, male students are typically graded 3 points less. Contrary to popular belief,  literally hundreds of studies show that half of all domestic violence victims are male, the majority of female victims of domestic violence actually have relationships where both parties are equally violent toward each other. The study claiming that one in 4 women will be raped was debunked, an estimated 40% of rapists are actually women<br/><br/>'Feminism', by definition, is (properly) concerned with female interests, not gender equality, although they may or may not be for gender equality. The argument that anyone who supports gender equality is necessarily a 'feminist' is as meaningful as claiming that Oxfam is 'pro-Black'. Egalitarians are as 'masculinist' as they are 'feminist'. Feminists often dismiss the idea of female privilege or anti-male sexism (not the harmful effects of patriarchy on men, I mean anti-male discrimination, which can be carried out by both men and women) and the suffering (or preference frustration) that it causes as unwarranted because they view discrimination against women as objectively wrong beyond the suffering (or preference frustration) that it causes women as opposed to being wrong on that basis (<span style="font-style: italic">because</span> it is harmful to women and not for any reason besides that which would 'validate' that harm). I'm not sure that 'feminism' as most people understand it is compatible with egalitarianism and I'd be interested in hearing what utilitarians make of the Men's Rights Movement. I disagree with most of their rhetoric but I've heard some compelling points from some of them.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Utilitarianism is just a basis for decision making, it doesn't make any empirical claims so it says nothing about which group generally has it worse which has nothing directly to do with whether or not specific actions maximize 'utility' anyways (I hate saying 'utility' because you can't maximize 'usefulness'), my main point is the idea of equal consideration and rejecting the women and children, or perceived underdog, first mentality.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>You make some valid points about society caring more about violence against females than against males ("saving the women and children," etc.).

As far as 'Men's Rights' is concerned, possibly correcting whatever sexist biases exist in the legal system when it comes to men receiving harsher sentences for the same crimes committed by women, making sure that  sex doesn't factor into parents being denied child custody or having to pay unfair alimony and just generally discouraging double standards that disadvantage either sex (or at least the disregard of either sex's interests if double standards are ever necessary) might all be good ideas.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Moreover, there can be reasons to favor helping women: e.g., <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_Effect">The Girl Effect</a> in international development.

For example, men are more likely to be vegans than women are, they're also less likely to to have out-group biases than women are, they're more likely to be impartial when it comes to ethical reasoning (there's actually some evidence that women are less likely to behave altruistically toward out group members since, typically, prehistoric men stayed in the villages of their parents after marrying and were thus more likely to be closely related to their neighbours than were prehistoric women who typically migrated to their husband's village after marriage and had more of a 'genetic self interest' in prioritizing the well being of their children over the community in general). You should also consider why women are less likely to be aggressive, care about animal suffering etc., if this is true, and to what extent socializing boys in a completely different way could change this. People are 'useful' to the extent that they maximize the welfare of others but their own welfare also has intrinsic value.<br/><br/>Utilitarians should be consistent and avoid sentiment.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I also think self-reporting bias may play a role in statistics claiming that women have higher levels of depression and general anxiety disorders. In fact, I remember coming across an article claiming that men are less emotionally resilient than women are, I can't find it but I found this instead : <a class="postlink" href="http://owenmarcus.com/uncategorized/guess-what-turns-out-men-are-more-sensitive-than-women-part-1/">http://owenmarcus.com/uncategorized/gue ... en-part-1/</a> . I can't find the articles claiming that men are more likely to be vegan, altruistic toward out-group members etc.( although I was aware that women are more likely to be vegetarians ) but I found this : <a class="postlink" href="http://eternalbachelor.wordpress.com/2007/07/17/men-more-altruistic-in-war/">http://eternalbachelor.wordpress.com/20 ... ic-in-war/</a> and this : <a class="postlink" href="http://news.menshealth.com/new-research-your-girlfriend-is-a-horrible-person/2011/06/29/">http://news.menshealth.com/new-research ... 011/06/29/</a> which doesn't really prove anything. It's also worth noting that being less physically aggressive doesn't necessarily imply being less 'aggressive'. I've never really taken the idea that women are more compassionate or caring than men seriously, if they are, on average, I doubt it's by much. I could be wrong but it seems like something we're supposed to say to be respectful and correct misogynistic assumptions of male superiority. Whites and Asians do, on average, have higher IQs than Blacks but the assumption is still considered to be 'racist', the assumption that women are generally kinder, whether it's true or not, is not considered 'sexist' toward men even though it clearly portrays one sex in a more favorable light than the other. You would still have to favor compassionate men over less caring women, based on their instrumental value, even if women were 90% more likely to be altruistic.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

(This is true in general whenever discussions of gender differences arise. When they exist, gender differences are usually very small relative to the standard deviation of the population.)<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ubuntu wrote:</cite>You would still have to favor compassionate men over less caring women, based on their instrumental value<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Definitely. In general, breaking things down along gender lines is rarely the best way to slice things. There are other variables that correlate much better with whatever we're trying to get at.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Hi Ubuntu! I was thinking about making a post to Felicifia about the apparent contradiction between utilitarianism and feminism myself. Glad I didn't because yours is much better <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/><br/><br/>As utilitarians, I think another important piece of evidence we need to consider is the self-reported happiness of men vs women. There's been some interesting research on this in recent years, and some controversy over a study which found women's happiness declining relative to men's in recent decades (which was hyped as "feminism made women miserable"). A good rundown is here: <a class="postlink" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1753">http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1753</a> <br/><br/>The data is pretty messy, but I think the take-home is that there isn't a very meaningful gap between male and female happiness in the US (though there's room to argue here for some kind of reporting bias I guess -- women "suffering in silence"). On top of Ubuntu's other stats, it seems to support the contention that seeking to improve the lives of western women relative to men shouldn't be high on our list of priorities as utilitarians. <br/><br/>But that doesn't mean that many specific feminist campaigns aren't justified. Even if women are on balance roughly as happy, and living longer, combating rape clearly has utilitarian value (a problem you seem to be grossly downplaying -- are you seriously suggesting that female on male (or female on child) rape is as big a social problem as male on female rape?). It's likely not the optimal use of our attention or charitable giving, but then, what cause in a developed country is?<br/><br/>I think one of the crucial points missing in this issue is the status of women in non-western and developing countries. I just returned from India, where male on female domestic violence and rape are rife; women are often disempowered, undereducated and overworked relative to men, and lack many of the simple freedoms men enjoy (in most of the smaller towns you would almost never see women outside on the street). There and in many other countries, girls are routinely married, sold or trafficked into sexually abusive situations. Here, I think the assumption of male privilege is probably justified, and it could well be an effective utilitarian strategy to focus efforts on women's specific issues. (Or, of course, it might be better to focus on alleviating hunger or medical care for both sexes; that is an empirical question).</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

If you punish someone because they're a guy or because they're black, there's no incentive, even if it does make your guess of whether or not they did it more accurate. As such, you should only punish people based on evidence that exists because they committed the crime.<br/><br/>This does get more complicated if they don't use CDT.

I agree that the point of punishment should be to deter crime but if punishment is justified because it provides an incentive for people not to commit crime (or to physically prevent them from doing so) and if women (or whatever group is statistically less likely to commit crime) are more likely to commit crime, not compared to other groups but compared to what would be the crime rate among women if women believed that they would be judged just as harshly as men, wouldn't that be an argument for giving equal sentences for the same crimes? Also, if we're talking about the likeliness of an individual committing a crime and not just punishing them more severely compared to someone else who commits the exact same crime, are they that much more likely to commit a crime or does the bulk of how much more likely they are assumed to have committed a crime stem from cultural prejudice? How much of a role do these stereotypes play in making men more likely to commit crime to begin with?<br/><br/>Either way, I don't think that sentencing men, or Black men specifically, more often or more harshly than women or White men, is a calculated decision carried out reluctantly by people who factor their well-being into consideration.
