<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Philosopher Jeff McMahan has published a most interesting article on intervention in predation in the NY Times. The paper can be read here: <br/><br/><a class="postlink" href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/the-meat-eaters/?hp">http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/20 ... eaters/?hp</a><br/><br/>The comments on the paper in the Times are terribly poor and simplistic. However, there's a very interesting discussion on it going on here:<br/><br/><a class="postlink" href="http://onthehuman.org/2010/09/the-meat-eaters/">http://onthehuman.org/2010/09/the-meat-eaters/</a><br/><br/>Many blogs and sites have started to discuss the paper. Many of them are rather stupid. But in others one can find serious opinions and discussions. For instance, here:<br/><br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.practicalethicsnews.com/practicalethics/2010/09/should-we-rid-the-world-of-carnivores-if-we-could.html#more">http://www.practicalethicsnews.com/prac ... .html#more</a><br/><br/><a class="postlink" href="http://philosophersanon.blogspot.com/2010/09/meat-eaters-by-jeff-mcmahan.html">http://philosophersanon.blogspot.com/20 ... mahan.html</a><br/><br/><a class="postlink" href="http://the-brooks-blog.blogspot.com/2010/09/jeff-mcmahan-on-meat-eaters">http://the-brooks-blog.blogspot.com/201 ... eat-eaters</a>.<br/><br/><a class="postlink" href="http://deconstructioninc.wordpress.com/2010/09/21/jeff-mcmahan-again/">http://deconstructioninc.wordpress.com/ ... han-again/</a><br/><br/>I encourage all of you concerned with wild-animal suffering to engage in these discussions</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I've argued that the concept of preventing predation is FAR removed from popular morals. I think that there is no chance that even 5% of the general population are convinced to prevent predation any time in the next 20 years. To common people, intervention in nature for the welfare of animals is not only immoral, it is absurd.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Utilitymonster, I agree that intellectual level of response was generally poor.<br/>But set in a wider context, the publication of Jeff McMahan's NYT piece is encouraging. "The Meat Eaters" is a landmark: the first essay in a mainstream print publication openly calling for predation to be phased out. Print-publication makes it easier for other sympathetic people to "come out" and do the same without being branded lone cranks. <br/>[ Any researcher worth his or her salt enjoys occasionally being controversial.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">I think Ryan's right that focusing too much on issues we can't realistically hope to influence is counterproductive. It's easy to accuse those saying 'it's impossible' of ignoring McMahan's caveat, but I'm not sure they're the ones missing the point. Is it really worth putting work-hours into saying 'if x weren't false, it would imply y'? That's a typical philosophers' stereotype, and one that utilitarians should abhor succumbing to.<br/><br/>Given that so many of the knee-jerk responses are variations on the 'it's impossible' theme, it seems like the main requirement for public acceptance of the idea is simply proof-of-concept, so why enrol for a Sisyphean struggle until then?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">The worst source of severe and avoidable suffering in the world today is factory farming. Its abolition should presumably be an overriding priority. But I still think utilitarians should articulate our long-term goal of reducing / abolishing predation - and wild animal suffering in general - even if the timescale is many decades and even centuries distant. Not least, some of the issues are topical right now. Thus should we support captive breeding programs for predators, "rewilding" [ <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewilding_(conservation_biology">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewilding_ ... on_biology</a>) ] and similar initiatives in so-called conservation biology?<br/><br/>Clearly I'd say no; but this needs to be argued. More generally, the greater our perceived complicity in suffering, the more readily an audience is prepared to question its necessity - and our perceived complicity in "wild" animal suffering is steadily going to increase over the next few decades.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Something that just occurred to me - maybe it's a mistake to treat this as an umbrella topic. Some predators seem obviously more harmful than others, generally because they're parasitic or just less quick to kill their victims, for whatever reason. Some charming examples that spring to mind:<br/><br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bumblebee.org/invertebrates/Hymenoptera3.htm">Ichneumonid Wasps</a>: 'When the wasp hatches from the egg it starts to eat the body of the caddis fly larva. However, it does no eat the nervous system, as it does not want to kill the caddis larva. Only once the caddis larva has fixed its case to a stone to prepare for pupation will the wasp kill it by eating all the caddis larva.'<br/><br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Organisms.cfm">Sacculina Carcini</a>: 'The female Sacculina punches numerous holes in the neutered crab's body so that male barnacles can get in and fertilize its eggs. Once that's accomplished, the tendrils take over the crab's nervous system, making it autonomously guard, care for and clean the parasitic egg sac as if it were its own. And once they hatch, a repeat performance is in order.'<br/><br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.montereybaywhalewatch.com/Features/KillerWhalePredation0210.htm">Killer Whales</a>: 'As much as six hours may pass from initial attack to kill with ramming, biting, pulling on the pectoral fins, and attempts to separate the mother from the calf.'<br/><br/>(this one might be a less popular, but it meets the criteria) <a class="postlink" href="http://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/hedon1.htm#feline">Domestic cats</a>: 'We admire their magnificent beauty, strength and agility. But we would regard their notional human counterparts as wanton psychopaths of the worst kind.'<br/><br/>Why not discuss eradicating/vegetarianising some or all of these species as a priority? That would postpone or at least mitigate the question of serious ecological damage, other predatory species that just got on with killing relatively quickly would still be around to pick up the shortfall.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">As for the simplistic comments at the NYT site, I think they were to be expected. The interesting debates are those taking place in serious blogs and sites, such as the ones linked above. <br/><br/>Regarding the idea that focusing too much on issues we can't realistically hope to influence might be counterproductive, I'd say that the issue of wild-animal suffering is so important that even if we do not seem to make progress we must focus on it 0.000001% success in cause A is much preferable to 100% success in cause B if A produces more than 10^8 times the value B produces. <br/><br/>Another point I'd like to mention, I don't think I agree with focusing in those predators that cause more harm. In fact, I don't even think that our main target should be predation itself, even though addressing the predation issue helps raising the idea of intervening in nature. AFAIK, we have strong reasons to believe that the main way to reduce suffering in nature is by reducing the number of r-selected individuals that come to existence. r-selected animals are those who have huge progenies with extremely low chances of surviving. (Most animals are r-selected). <br/><br/>There are several ways to do this. Killing these animals is <span style="font-style: italic">not </span>one of them, since they would be substitued by others. Reducing the carrying capacity for them in ecosystems is a key one. This means turning the places in which they live (their biotopes) less able to support them (mainly, by reducing the amount of food available in them).</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Good question, utilitymonster.<br/><br/>The intuition is that death tends to be painful, so that the fewer years (or, for many insects, weeks) of life you get beforehand, the worse is your balance of possibly-happy life against painful death. So in general, one expects longer lifespans to be better.<br/><br/>Of course, this is speaking just in terms of adult lifespans. What's more important with r-vs.-K selection is that r-selected species have vast numbers of offspring that don't even reach adulthood -- almost all the children die (perhaps painfully) soon after birth. So the expected lifespan for a random individual born to an r-selected species could be just a few days.<br/><br/>Yew-Kwang Ng makes a related theoretical argument in his "Toward Welfare Biology" paper. I tried to summarize it in section 4 of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/wild-animals.pdf">this piece</a>.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">rehoot, it's true that if just predators became vegetarians, there would be probably *more* suffering. But this is an example of naive intervention. As you say, managing the behaviors of predators is extremely difficult. <br/><br/>I don't know what is the best solution about this problem, but I think we must not give a solution already. I hope than future more-knowledged humans can do something about.<br/><br/>On the other hand, McMahan and other authors (Sapontzis, Fink, Pearce...) wrote interesting essays about this issue, but I think they focus on predation a lot. Predation isn't the only reason of wild-animal suffering, so I prefer the Alan Dawrst's approach: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/wild-animals.pdf">www.utilitarian-essays.com/wild-animals.pdf</a></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<h3><a href="#p2529">Re: McMahan on predation and intervention in nature</a></h3>
<p class="author"><img alt="Post" height="9" src="../styles/nexus/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" title="Post" width="11"/>by <strong><a href="../user/82.html">David Olivier</a></strong> on 2011-01-24T16:41:00</p>
<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Traditionally the issue of a non-speciesist attitude towards wild animals has been framed as being about predation; perhaps as a response to those who use the "saving the rabbit from the fox" <span style="font-style: italic">reductio</span> against animal liberation and the animal liberation requirement for renouncing meat, that is for <span style="font-style: italic">humans</span> to end their predation. But I think that Alan Dawrst's approach of speaking about wild animal suffering generally is original and right. Death from disease or starvation is just as bad, and perhaps, often worse, than death from predation.<br/><br/>However, I disagree with the idea put forward by Alan, Peter Singer before him, and here Daniel Dorado and others that any intervention against predation today is unthinkable, because there is such a probability that it will backfire catastrophically. Peter Singer (quoted in <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-nature.html">Alan's piece</a>) said:<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>for practical purposes I am fairly sure, judging from man's past record of attempts to mold nature to his own aims, that we would be more likely to increase the net amount of animal suffering if we interfered with wildlife, than to decrease it. Lions play a role in the ecology of their habitat, and we cannot be sure what the long-term consequences would be if we were to prevent them from killing gazelles. [...] So, in practice, I would definitely say that wildlife should be left alone.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>This is often repeated, but I have never seen any supporting evidence, except for a few examples, always the same, like that of an island where the deer had no more predators and suffered a population explosion and then famine. I don't think that there is any general biological law that says that a species always needs a predator to control its population. If there was, why doesn't it apply to the predators themselves? Who is the predator of the wolves?<br/><br/>It is probable that in some cases the danger of a population explosion is real, and in others not. Things have to be judged on a case-by-case basis.<br/><br/>More generally, "man's past record of attempts to mold nature to his own aims" does not give good evidence about what could be done if we attempted to intervene for benevolent purposes. I mean, in the past human intervention has generally been done for greed, or at best for purely human aims. The success or failure of those attempts must be judged on their own terms, that is against their own aims. It is not surprising, for instance, that interventions that were not conceived to benefit wild animals didn't benefit them. Generally those interventions were a <span style="font-style: italic">success</span> on their own terms. Sometimes they went wrong - on their own terms - but certainly that is a minority of the cases.<br/><br/>Of course things any intervention would have to be thought out with due care, but I see no a priori reason to believe, for instance, that we should not encourage the disappearance of some birds of prey that are already on the verge of extinction.<br/><br/>I think we should shed a lot of our preconceptions about the harmonies of nature ("Lions play a role in the ecology of their habitat"). A good read is Daniel Botkin, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.danielbbotkin.com/books/discordant-harmonies/">Discordant Harmonies</a>, which for me was an eye-opener.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Hi David. Thank you for the feedback.<br/><br/>I agree with you about things being judged on a case-by-case basis. And I don't see any harmony of nature. Nature is more a hell.<br/><br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>David Olivier wrote:</cite>It is not surprising, for instance, that interventions that were not conceived to benefit wild animals didn't benefit them. Generally those interventions were a <span style="font-style: italic">success</span> on their own terms. Sometimes they went wrong - on their own terms - but certainly that is a minority of the cases.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I agree. But can we expect that most interventions will be conceived to benefit wild animals in this speciesist society? I don't think so. Most interventions will be done to benefit humans, so they will not improve the <span style="font-style: italic">interventionist curriculum</span>.<br/><br/>The Peter Singer's quote is very conservative, and I wouldn't say that any intervention in the wild will have negative consequences. I think that neutering predators reduces suffering in some cases, but not in others. We can support some good interventions in the wild now; this shows that interventions in the wild is not a sci-fi thing. But I think the best that we can do isn't this, but to promote anti-speciesism and the "wild-animal suffering meme".</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
