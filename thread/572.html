<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Hi all! Anyone interested in being paid to work on utilitarian activities full-time? Well, here's the opportunity! It's worth emphasizing that, between the two organisations, the goal is not limited to global poverty alleviation, but also combating animal suffering, x-risk mitigation and anything else that is plausibly the highest-value use of one's resources.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Will<br/>(MD of GWWC and President of 80K)<br/><br/>Here's the message!:<br/><br/><br/>Giving What We Can and 80,000 Hours are recruiting!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Giving What We Can and 80,000 Hours are both taking paid staff from next year. So if you would be interested in working part or full-time next year for either of these two organisations, then please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:niel.bowerman@givingwhatwecan.org">niel.bowerman@givingwhatwecan.org</a> by the 2nd March, 5pm GMT, with a short description telling us a little bit about yourself. We can then send you further information on how to apply, and on what working with us would involve.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Areas in which we are particularly interested in hiring are:<br/><br/>· Strategic Research. Both organisations are highly concerned to know whether their method is the optimal way to make the world a better place; and, if it isn’t, how we can improve it. We’re looking to hire staff to help us to answer that question.<br/><br/>o If you have strong research skills, have performed well academically, and are sympathetic to the GWWC or 80k way of thinking, then you would fit well into this role. Relevant background subjects include but are not limited to: philosophy, mathematics, economics and the other sciences.<br/><br/>· Operations and management. In order for the organisations to remain secure and successful, we would need strong support on an operational level.<br/><br/>o If you have an eye for detail, and especially if you have previous experience working within operations or management, then you could flourish in this role.<br/><br/>· Volunteer Recruitment. Both organisations are largely run by volunteers, and are looking to expand significantly next year. We’re especially looking to recruit highly dedicated volunteers who are willing to work 10hrs/week or more.<br/><br/>o If you are people-minded, or have experience with volunteer-run organisations previously, then this could be the role for you.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Potential employment is not limited to these roles, however, and there would be considerable room for any employee to partially write their own role. What we are principally looking for are dedicated people who understand and support the GWWC or 80k approach to making the world a better place.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If you were to work for either organisation, you would have considerable flexibility in your work, as part of a young and fast-growing charity. You’d be working in the company of other highly intelligent and enthusiastic staff, among a community of people doing their best to make a huge positive impact on the world. It’s an exciting opportunity!<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, even if you’re not sure, but you’re interested in finding out more, please register your interest by e-mailing <a href="mailto:niel.bowerman@givingwhatwecan.org">niel.bowerman@givingwhatwecan.org</a>.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thanks for your interest,<br/><br/>The GWWC and 80K Teams</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
