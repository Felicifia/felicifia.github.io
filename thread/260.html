<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Hey everyone, would still love to hear everyone's thoughts on Mike's thread on <a class="postlink" href="../thread/257.html">meta-ethics</a>, but i thought this would be an interesting as well.  I was just returned a book I had lent out to a friend a while back "<a class="postlink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Fabric-Reality-Parallel-Universes-Implications/dp/014027541X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1271475866&amp;sr=8-1">The Fabric of Reality</a>" by David Deutsch.  For those not familiar with Deutsch, he is known most imfamously for support of the multiverse theory, and to a lesser degree as a quantum computation expert.  In "The Fabric of Reality" and elsewhere he indicates sympathies with Karl Popper's political views which as I understand them are "negative utilitarian".  (On a side note, Deutsch contemporary Michael Lockwood has had some <a class="postlink" href="http://philpapers.org/rec/LOCSOK">harsh words</a> for Peter Singer in the past.)  Towards the end of the book, the subject turns to the foundations of morality and this is what he has to say on utilitarianism:<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">Utilitarianism</span> was the earlier attempt to integrate moral explanations with the scientific world-view through 'usefulness'.  Here 'usefulness' was identified with calculating which action would produce the most happiness, either for one person or (and the theory became more vague here) for 'the greatest number' of people.  Different versions of the theory substituted 'pleasure' or 'preferece' for 'happiness'.  Considered as a repudiation of earlier, authoritarian systems of morality, utilitarianism is unexceptionable.  And in the sense that it simply advocates rejectiong dogma and acting on the 'preferred' theory, the one that has survived rational criticism, every rational person is a utilitarian.  But as an attempt to solve the problem we are discussing here, of explaining the meaning of moral judgements, it too has a fatal flaw: <span style="font-style: italic">we choose our preferences</span>.  In particular, we <span style="font-style: italic">change</span> our preferences, and we give moral explanations for doing so.  Such an explanation cannot be translated into utilitarian terms.  Is there an underlying, master-preference that controls preference changes?  If so, it could not itself be changed, and utilitarianism would degenerate into the genetic theory of morality discussed above.<br/><br/>Now, I certainly did not renounce my utilitarian views after reading this, but just playing <img alt=":twisted:" src="../images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif"/> devil's advocate here: how would you respond to Deutsch?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Perhaps you could describe what Deutsch means by "the genetic theory of morality discussed above."<br/><br/>Personally I'm not troubled by such criticisms because I have no desire to try and justify utilitarianism in metaethical terms. Indeed, I don't see how such a task would be accomplished for any ethical theory. As an adherent of <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotivism">emotivism</a>, I simply reply that I care about reducing suffering because that's the way my emotional reactions happen to work. I don't want to see others in pain just like I don't want to, say, be punched in the stomach.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">It seems to me that he is saying that utilitarianism cannot assign preferences a higher status than prejudices because both can change and can be chosen? I don't see that as a very scary criticism. <br/><br/>The point of utilitarianism is that if our preferences coincide with the state of affairs, then wellbeing is maximised, and that's a good thing.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Alan, here is the section where he describes the genetic theory of morality (also, the entire book can be read <a class="postlink" href="http://evolbiol.ru/deutsch/index_en.html">here</a> as an html file.  You may find it of interest Alan, Gary Drescher cites it many times in "<a class="postlink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Good-Real-Demystifying-Paradoxes-Bradford/dp/0262042339/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1271522234&amp;sr=8-1">Good and Real</a>"):<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>It is not only scientific knowledge that informs people's preferences and determines how they choose to behave. There are also, for instance, moral criteria, which assign attributes such as ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ to possible actions. Such values have been notoriously difficult to accommodate in the scientific world-view. They seem to form a closed explanatory structure of their own, disconnected from that of the physical world. As David Hume pointed out, it is impossible logically to derive an ‘ought’ from an ‘is’. Yet we use such values both to explain and to determine our physical actions.<br/><br/>The poor relation of morality is usefulness. Since it seems much easier to understand what is objectively useful or useless than what is objectively right or wrong, there have been many attempts to define morality in terms of various forms of usefulness. There is, for example, evolutionary morality, which notes that many forms of behaviour which we explain in moral terms, such as not committing murder, or not cheating when we cooperate with other people, have analogues in the behaviour of animals. And there is a branch of evolutionary theory, sociobiology, that has had some success in explaining animal behaviour. Many people have been tempted to conclude that moral explanations for human choices are just window-dressing; that morality has no objective basis at all, and that ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ are simply tags we apply to our inborn urges to behave in one way rather than another. Another version of the same explanation replaces genes by memes, and claims that moral terminology is just window-dressing for social conditioning. However, none of these explanations fits the facts. On the one hand, we do not tend to explain inborn behaviour — say, epileptic fits — in terms of moral choices; we have a notion of voluntary and involuntary actions, and only the voluntary ones have moral explanations. On the other hand, it is hard to think of a single inborn human behaviour — avoiding pain, engaging in sex, eating or whatever — that human beings have not under various circumstances chosen to override for moral reasons. The same is true, even more commonly, of socially conditioned behaviour. Indeed, overriding both inborn and socially conditioned behaviours is itself a characteristic human behaviour. So is explaining such rebellions in moral terms. None of these behaviours has any analogue among animals; in none of these cases can moral explanations be reinterpreted in genetic or memetic terms. This is a fatal flaw of this entire class of theories. Could there be a gene for overriding genes when one feels like it? Social conditioning that promotes rebellion? Perhaps, but that still leaves the problem of how we choose what to do instead, and of what we mean when we explain our rebellion by claiming that we were simply right, and that the behaviour prescribed by our genes or by our society in this situation was simply evil.  <br/><br/>These genetic theories can be seen as a special case of a wider stratagem, that of denying that moral judgements are meaningful on the grounds that we do not really choose our actions — that free will is an illusion incompatible with physics. But in fact, as we saw in Chapter 13, free will is compatible with physics, and fits quite naturally into the fabric of reality that I have described.<br/></div></blockquote><br/><br/>Alan, what books would you recommend reading relating to your emotivist views?  Would you say your views are different in degree or in kind to Hare's?  This is from the emotivist Wiki:<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div> while Hare was, no doubt, a critic of the [emotive theory], he was, in the eyes of his own critics, a kind of emotivist himself. His theory, as a consequence, has sometimes been depicted as a reaction against emotivism and at other times as an extension of it.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Ryan, I agree with you, and I do not see this as such a scary criticism.  I think that Deutsch is so stuck in his Popperian rights-based libertarianism, that he has to see the world through this lense:  <br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>My sitting quietly in a chair in my own home ‘harms’ everyone on Earth who might benefit from my going out and helping them at that moment; and it ‘harms’ any number of thieves who would like to steal the chair if only I went elsewhere for a while; and so on. To resolve such issues, I adduce further moral theories involving new explanations of my moral situation. When such an explanation seems satisfactory, I shall use it tentatively to make judgements of right and wrong. But the explanation, though temporarily satisfactory to me, still does not rise above the utilitarian level.<br/><br/>But now suppose that someone forms a general theory about such explanations themselves. Suppose that they introduce a higher-level concept, such as ‘human rights’, and guess that the introduction of that concept will, for a given class of moral problems like the one I have just described, always generate a new explanation that solves the problem in the utilitarian sense. Suppose, further, that this theory about explanations is itself an explanatory theory. It explains, in terms of some other strand, why analysing problems in terms of human rights is ‘better’ (in the utilitarian sense). For example, it might explain on epistemological grounds why respect for human rights can be expected to promote the growth of knowledge, which is itself a precondition for solving moral problems.<br/><br/>If the explanation seems good, it might be worth adopting such a theory. Furthermore, since utilitarian calculations are impossibly difficult to perform, whereas analysing a situation in terms of human rights is often feasible, it may be worth using a ‘human rights’ analysis in preference to any specific theory of what the happiness implications of a particular action are. If all this were true, it could be that the concept of ‘human rights’ is not expressible, even in principle, in terms of ‘happiness’ — that it is not a utilitarian concept at all. We may call it a moral concept. The connection between the two is through emergent explanation, not emergent prediction.<br/></div></blockquote></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">That's the trouble with criticisms of Consequentialism; they equate practicality with truth. Utilitarians attempt to act in the interests of the greater good, and noticing that this is a hard thing to do doesn't necessarily strike our theory down. Of course it's hard! Yes the greater good is heavily contingent on people's preferences, and yes maybe that makes the greater good unknowable, but it's still something we should drive at.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Alan, been reading up on emotivism today.  James Rachels has an interesting article on <a class="postlink" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=17i10ZZu8O4C&amp;pg=PA432&amp;lpg=PA432&amp;dq=%22companion+to+ethics%22+subjectivism+rachels&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=q51s6rCaD7&amp;sig=ZieWCd3U16egrT43vckNhpTwzSQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SX_LS6ffD8GBlAekmbT7BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">subjectivism</a> in the Singer edited "A Companion to Ethics" where he discusses emotivism in detail.  After discussing emotivism's benefits over "simple subjectivism" he has some criticisms:<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>There is no doubt that emotivism represented an advance over simple subjectivism.  This was not, however, the end of the story.  Emotivism also had its problems, and they were sufficiently serious that today most philosophers reject the theory.  One of the main problems was that emotivism could not account for the place of reason on ethics.<br/><br/>A moral judgement--or, for that matter, <span style="font-style: italic">any</span> kind of value judgement--must be supported by good reasons.  If someone tells you that a certain action would be wrong, for example, you may ask <span style="font-style: italic">why</span> it would be wrong, and if there is no satisfactory answer, you may reject that advice as unfounded.  In this way, moral judgements are different from mere expressions of personal preference.  If someone says 'I like coffee', he does not need to have a reason -- he may be making a statement about his personal taste, and nothing more.  But moral judgements require backing by reasons, and in the absence of such reasons, they are merely abitrary.  This is a point about the <span style="font-style: italic">logic</span> of moral judgement.  It is not merely that it would be a good thing to have reasons for one's moral judgements.  The point is stronger than that.  One <span style="font-style: italic">must</span> have reasons, or else one is not making a moral judgement at all.  Therefore, any adequate theory of the nature of moral judgements should be able to give some account of the connection between moral judgements and the reasons that support them.  It is at just this point that emotivism falters. </div></blockquote><br/><br/>I also consulted "<a class="postlink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Peter-Singer-Under-Fire/dp/0812696182/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1271641642&amp;sr=8-1">Peter Singer Under Fire</a>" and when talking about his relations with Hare he contrasts Hare's view with C.L. Stevenson's:<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Emotivists like C.L. Stevenson gave a prominent place to our freedomto make moral judgements based on our own attitudes.  If they were right, no one could tell us that we had simply failed to see some moral truth that a person of sharper moral insight knew to be true, for there were no such truths, only emotions or feelings to be expressed.  This liberating view seemed firmly grounded in G.E. Moore's famous argument against that "naturalistic fallacy" which involves defining morality in terms of natural properties (like happiness, for example), and in the evident oddity of the claim that we can just "intuit" non-naturali moral truths.  But emotivism is open to the obvious objection, that if morality is simply a matter of emotions or feeling, then your own view is no better than that of anyone else.  In saying that Nazism is wrong, we want to say something more than "Boo to the Nazis!"  But the emotivist has eliminated all other possible meanings that the condemnation of Nazism might have.<br/><br/>Hare agreed with the emotivists that moral judgements are not descriptions, and hence cannot be straightforwardly true or false.  He argued that they are prescriptions, that is, judgements that entail imperatives, but like imperatives, they are subject to logical rules.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>And so on...<br/><br/>Have you considered arguments along these lines Alan?  what you would say in response to Rachels and Singer?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>A moral judgment--or, for that matter, any kind of value judgment--must be supported by good reasons</div></blockquote><br/><br/>It's true that most people care about logic and rationality in their ethical stances, but this too is just a preference on their part. There are certainly people who don't care about logical ethical consistency -- they will not be particularly alarmed if you show them a flaw in their thinking. I suppose you could say that such people are not expressing moral opinions at all in that case; if so, we're simply talking about two definitions of morality (where Rachels and others would insist on <span style="font-style: italic">defining</span> morality to include concern for logic). Of course, I suppose "the definition of morality" is the entire point of this discussion....<br/><br/>My problem with "giving reasons" in ethics is that it runs into the problem of justification: At some point, if you keep asking "why?", the answer has to be "just because." Unless it's turtles all the way down, you have to ground any argument in a fundamental assumption, and that fundamental assumption is nothing more than an emotion.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">I don't agree with emotivism, but that first quote doesn't seem much of a challenge to it. As I understand it, emotivists take the view that when you've expressed your preference for a system of ethics, there's nothing more to say on the fundamentals - you just see where the system leads you. Rachels seems to assert that ethics is what you do re the fundamentals after you've expressed your preference.<br/><br/>If so, as Alan says, he's just working from a different definition of ethics, which is just a terminology decision, not a challenge. That said, he isn't obviously contradicting Alan. It's quite possible to take both views - that there's nothing beyond preference-expression and that ethics is whatever exists beyond preference expression. Then so much the worse for ethics and all who 'study' it!</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
