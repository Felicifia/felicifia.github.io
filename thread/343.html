<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">That's true. See I think Egoism is easier to interpret than utilitarianism. Prioritarianism is harder to interpret than utilitarianism. Because it aggregates two things together - happiness and fairness. But once you press on beyond two, it gets very tricky. For example, in biomedical ethics, a four principles system is commonly promoted, involving beneficience, nonmaleficience, autonomy and justice. As you can imagine, figuring out which principle dominates which other principle in certain situations is a nightmare. If you would like to share a patient's STD history with their wife in order to treat them, what should you do? Should you act in the interest of benefiting this wife's physical health. And in the interest of justice - surely it is only fair that they should both know an equal amount. Or should you refrain from risking a blow to the husband's mental health, caused by a breach of confidentiality, given also that breaching his confidentiality is generally regarded as compromising his autonomy?<br/><br/>This argument never leads anywhere. One principle is a system for figuring out answers in ethics. It's hard, but eventually, answers can be reached, even if it takes years of research. But multiple principles is impossible. People just stop even trying to aggregate the principles together, and they just use them to justify their intuitions instead. It's a disaster.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

You've been a real pain in the neck, so you don't deserve to get rid of yours." "We can't search for a cure for old age. Humanity doesn't deserve immortality."<br/><br/>Then again, I might be misinterpreting that. I'm not sure what "justice" means. I think it's one of those words like "liberty", which pretty much means whatever you want it to.<br/><br/>Having multiple principles shouldn't be too much of a problem if you come up with a standard comparing them. Just come up with a unit, and give examples with how many units are cause from each one.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I know I'm going back and forth but the gang-rape/burning cats for fun scenario still bothers me, not as far as practical scenarios are concerned but in theory. Aren't there some scenarios where causing someone a great deal of suffering is the only way to increase a lesser amount of pleasure for many more people? Altruistic hedonism is beginning to appeal to me, I think the world would be a better place if everyone (as much as is practical) prioritized the happiness and suffering of other beings over their own and the gang rape scenarios would become a non-concern if the men were altruists. HU also has some other 'repugnant' conclusions, like preferring a universe with many moderately happy people over one with fewer extremely happy people. The only thing I'm absolutely certain about is that happiness is the only intrinsic good. A pluralistic theory of value prevents people from making consistent, moral judgments, in my view, because there is no standard they can use to determine when to prefer which value. <br/><br/>I don't agree with prioritarianism although I'm still not sure I understand it. Why is causing 10 points of suffering to a low-class, blue collar worker worse than causing 20 points of suffering to a wealthy businessman?  According to prioritarianism, what qualifies someone as being 'worse off'? If it's their emotional state of mind, than prioritarians might as well just say that alleviating suffering is more important than maximizing happiness and call themselves negative utilitarians.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Yes but, in theory, utilitarians could participate in that rape. Altruists could not and if everyone were an altruist, then not even in theory would it be justified.<br/><br/>What do you mean different goals? Each person's goal is to increase the happiness/decrease the suffering of other beings. You could say that nobody benefits from altruism if everyone is an altruist but look at Christmas, everyone is preoccupied with buying gifts for other people, not themselves, yet they are still happy when they open their gifts and they should be since being happy will make the people who bought those gifts for them happy. <br/><br/>My problem isn't with the logic of HU, it's worth noting that utilitarianism can justify promoting ethical schools other than utilitarianism.<br/><br/>Merry Christmas, by the way!</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">DanielLC, it's plausible that altruism might be a good philosophy for increasing overall happiness.<br/><br/>Positive psychology scientists often say there's a paradox of happiness. If you think about and try to pursue happiness directly, you're unlikely to be effective. You need to seek out relatives of happiness such as a good job and good friends. Then, you can pursue happiness while slightly averting your eyes from it. Aiming for career can maximise your happiness.<br/><br/>Aiming for others' happiness could plausibly maximise total happiness. And as you'll hear people like people singer say, giving to charity can make you feel good about yourself. So, being altruistic could be a good idea for an egoist.<br/><br/>A guy who talks a lot about this is Shelly Kagan. He draws a sharp line between what you want to maximise, and what mode of thought is likely to achieve it. In the first chapter or two of his book Normative Ethics, and in some of his ethics lectures.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>How do you figure?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Utilitarianism is concerned solely with consequences, with maximizing whatever is considered good and minimizing whatever is considered bad. If it were true that promoting deontology would produce a greater balance of happiness over suffering than would promoting utilitarianism, then utilitarianism would require that we promote deontology instead of utilitarianism. The truth has no inherent value and neither does logic, what matters is happiness/suffering (or preference satisfaction/frustration).<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br/>If you do what maximizes other happiness, you'll result in more total happiness than if you maximize total happiness?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>No, I'm just predicting that a world where everyone prioritized the happiness of other people would have more happiness than one where everyone was equally concerned with their own happiness as they were with everyone else's. Ryan Carey put it well, people are happier when they empathize with others and behave altruistically. And even if utilitarianism, in practice, can probably not justify gang rape, burning puppies etc. for the greater good, many people are demoralized by the idea that this is even theoretically justifiable, so there's no point in promoting utilitarianism for it's own sake, it should only be promoted because it 'works'.<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>When you maximize happiness, that means go with whatever results in the most happiness. If you find out that altruistic hedonism results in more happiness, that doesn't mean altruism is better.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>It does mean that altruism is 'better', not more logical, but 'better' in that it accomplishes the goal of utilitarianism more effectively than utilitarianism itself does. I'm not sure that altruism would, I'm just currently leaning towards the idea that it would. The idea of altruism seems more endearing to me, it probably will to many other people as well.<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div> It means you messed up somewhere.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I don't understand.<br/><br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div> You can't increase something to above the maximum.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I don't understand this either.<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The choice of whether or not to make humanity extinct fits this criteria, because to allow humanity to continue will mean causing (allowing) a great deal of suffering for some people and a lesser amount of pleasure for many more (presumably...I'm just assuming that the happiness balance of humanity is positive; also, it's a lesser amount of pleasure for others because humans have the capacity for a greater intensity of suffering than they do happiness). But the large majority of people have the intuition that we should allow humanity to continue. What do you think?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I consider myself to be an anti-natalist (because humans experience pain more easily than we experience happiness, the possible negative consequences of bringing a new being into the world outweigh the possible positive consequences, not to mention ecological reasons, overpopulation, the number of children who already need homes etc.) and an abolitionist. When the biotechnology to eliminate suffering has been created, there are no more orphans, global warming etc. has been dealt with, I will no longer be an anti-natalist. The blowing up the world scenario is a lot more tolerable to me than gang raping someone if it increases a greater amount of pleasure for relatively happy people is because I'm fine with 'nothingness', I have a strong aversion to suffering.<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Hmm, not if the woman was an altruist!</div></blockquote><br/><br/>If she were an altruist, it wouldn't be 'rape'. Altruism can only work if the majority of humans become altruists and I think the best way to promote altruism is by example.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>It seems to me that this logically implies utilitarianism until you introduce another principle/ethical fact.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I'm not absolute about promoting altruism instead of utilitarianism but if I am pro-altruism, I'd promote it for utilitarian reasons, lol.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I don't think I'd promote it though for the sole reason that utilitarianism makes much more sense than altruism as the fundamental ethical principle, and so people will be far less likely to always try to act according to altruistic principles.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Ubuntu, you're going through various positions that need a different perspective each to be answered.<br/><br/>First, about the claim that the world would be better or have more happiness balance if everyone followed altruistic hedonism. This is a vacuous statement, a moot point. It's a truth that is devoid of content because it asserts "if A then B" when in fact A is inherently false. Matter-of-factly not everyone will follow the same ethical theory, and if your reliance on altruistic hedonism depends on everyone following it, well that's a pretty big flaw there. The argument 'it would be better if everyone followed it' is by no means a compelling one, it has a fictional condition to be met. And the scenario of a woman freely letting herself get having sex with someone unknown on the street because of altruism is ridiculous (edit - Ryan).<br/><br/>Second, you say you're leaning towards altruistic hedonism instead of utilitarianism because you have the feeling that it's better, you really give no explanation as to why this would be the case.<br/><br/>The argument that it produces more happiness than utilitarianism is false, utilitarianism searches to produce the outcome with the most happiness, and there is no more happiness to produce than the most. E.g. in a range from -10 to 10 if the maximum happiness that can come out of a situation is 7, then the most happiness an ethical theory can aspire to produce is 7 whether it is called altruistic hedonism or utilitarianism. Utilitarianism always looks for the maximum by definition, altruistic hedonism doesn't, so utilitarianism is best (taking into account that good is happy, better is more happy, best is most happy).<br/><br/>The other argument you provide is regarding greater balance of happiness. You say that this or that gives greater balance of happiness (<span style="font-style: italic">'I just think that the best way to achieve the greatest balance of happiness over suffering is [...]'</span>), but you don't explain what you mean by balance, or why should balance be a concern. But you also said:<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ubuntu wrote:</cite>I define 'good' as happiness. The world is 'better' when there is more happiness/less suffering.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>So what role does 'balance' have in the equation?<br/><br/>edit - Ryan: I've edited out a line of ridicule that is potentially abusive. I don't moderate often, but let me know if there is a problem.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
