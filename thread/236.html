<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">There are plenty of interesting options. I've chosen medicine, so I'm open to either pursue a lifetime of <span style="font-weight: bold">wealth</span> (selling plastic surgery in a western capital city) or <span style="font-weight: bold">direct service</span> (infection control in the third world).<br/><br/>There is a third possibility that stands out to me though: the <span style="font-weight: bold">communication</span> of utilitarianism. Consider that if in your entire lifetime, you persuade only two other people to do their best to be utilitarian, that will improve the world twice as much as serving those in need directly. So how should we go about motivating people to be utilitarian?<br/><br/>Politics is an interesting suggestion. But it doesn't seem very utilitarian to me. Getting electing in the first place requires vast amounts of time, resources, and luck. Once you gain a seat in parliament, your vote is only one of many. 90% of the time, you'll have to make popular decisions ahead of tough ones. To put it differently, you'll be at the mercy of your population's prejudices, rather than their wellbeing. Even if you do write some utilitarian policy, it might not last very many years at all. Once some other politician replaces you, they'll undo some of your extreme utilitarian policy. The political climate might even bounce back to a less utilitarian position than before you turned up. That's the nature of politics.<br/><br/>How else could you communicate utilitarianism? You could train yourself in ethics then teach it. You could write books about ethics like Peter Singer. You could try to cultivate a utilitarian sentiment among activists. You could have some kids and raise them to be altruistic. <br/><br/>It seems to me that one utilitarian can do only a little to improve the world but a utilitarian who can communicate utilitarianism to others can improve the world a lot. There's obvious potential in this concept, but I can only speculate on how it might best be realised.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">It's a good think you're thinking about this so young, WAN.  You should give this question careful consideration because it is likely to be the most important decision you ever make.<br/><br/>If you want to do as much good as possible, here are some paths of life that I'd take seriously.  I'd break the kinds of jobs into three categories: get rich and give jobs, influence jobs, and research jobs. (The distinction between 2 and 3 might be a bit arbitrary, but let's imagine researchers aren't primarily trying to convince people to be researchers or givers.) Anyway, here are examples in each category.<br/><br/>1.Get rich and give (Finance jobs: investment banking, hedge funds, private equity; some lucrative area of law; entrepreneurship)<br/>2.Influence jobs (Philosophy professor preaching ethics; Public health, advise a large organization, like WHO; work for some big international aid organization, and try to get to the top)<br/>3.Research jobs (Medical research (neglected tropical diseases maybe); places like GiveWell or Poverty Action Lab)<br/><br/>If we compare type 1 and type 2, we should ask: could givers pay/convince more people to be influencers or could influencers convince more people to be givers? If the former, 1 beats 2. If the latter, 2 beats 1. Perhaps you could argue that there aren't enough people willing and able to be influencers of the appropriate kind, and thus that it would be better for you to be an influencer.<br/><br/>But it might be questioned whether the influencers are really better at influencing. Compare, for instance, a preaching philosophy professor and a finance professional. As a professor you might interact with more students, but as a financial professional you might have contact with many individuals with a lot of wealth.  Although you'd directly contact fewer individuals, you might be more likely to convince a friend or a colleague to give away income than a student.  Even if you convince fewer people to become do-gooders, it might be better to convince a few rich people than it would be to convince a larger number of students.<br/><br/>3 can only win if influencers can't influence people to do the research as well as you could do it yourself and givers can't hire people to do the research as well as you could do it yourself. If they can't, the question will be very difficult to answer.<br/><br/>I guess my view is that your best bet is to try to get as rich as possible (but this is just a hunch, at this point).  If you can do it, and you wouldn't totally hate it, I'd try to get one of the finance jobs mentioned above.  To do this, you should aim to get into the best place you can for undergrad, and then you should study a math-heavy discipline (physics, math, statistics, some kind of engineering), perhaps minoring or double-majoring in finance.  Then, learn as much as you can, nail all of your classes, and network like hell.  At any rate, though, any of these jobs would do pretty well.<br/><br/>Let us know what you decide.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev hidden" data-snap="1">I agree with Alan Dawrst's conclusion: barring special circumstances, utilitarians should make lots of money and buy lots of good with it.  This conclusion is particularly important for a young utilitarian considering alternative careers, since the choices one makes at that age will largely determine one's future earning potential.  I don't know what your expected lifetime savings would be as a plastic surgeon, but I'm inclined to think that you could amass a larger fortune by becoming an investment banker or a Wall Street analyst instead.  At any rate, that would probably have been my own career choice if I had thought about these issues early enough in my life (instead, I made the terrible mistake of becoming a philosopher).

You have to multiply the expected value of a career in <span style="font-style: italic">x </span>by the likelihood that you'll be interested enough to get going in <span style="font-style: italic">x</span>. Financial jobs aren't so lucrative (especially per working hour) that alternatives don't start to look better if you're convinced you'd enjoy them vs lukewarm about finance. The amount you persuade yourself to give is probably correlated with your happiness too, so all things being equalish, you're likely to donate a higher proportion of your income the more you enjoy the job.<br/><br/>Also, financial jobs might become less valuable than, say, certain types of engineering, when the effects of peak oil kick in, depending on how much it screws the global economy. Fortunately, engineering needs maths too, so if you can get into maths at all it's probably a safe bet to stick with it for as long as you can. <br/><br/>If you have trouble motivating yourself...<br/><br/><img alt="Image" src="http://www.smbc-comics.com/comics/20091116.gif"/><br/><br/><img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Wow, what fantastic replies. This is incredible. Forgive me for being awe-struck, but in my neck of the woods, ethics is pretty much defined as what the Bible says, what your family says, and what a "real man" would do.<br/><br/>I will continue to search for the right path, but for what it's worth, my current goal is business/finance/economics. I decide this simply because it holds opportunities for all three of the "main strategies" for utilitarian life. There's monetary power (earning lots of dollars), influential power (what the boss says goes), and direct power (managing a nonprofit or other good organization),<br/><br/>This could easily change... But I'm working on it! I'm still open to suggestions, and you know, by getting me on the right path, you guys are having a utilitarian impact = my lifetime of service  <img alt=":D" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif"/></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<p class="author"><img alt="Post" height="9" src="../styles/nexus/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" title="Post" width="11"/>by <strong><a href="../user/64.html">Brian Tomasik</a></strong> on 2010-02-02T08:36:00</p>
<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">I agree this is a great discussion! A few notes:<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">Hmmm, I haven't thought of that. So a lifetime of wealth is worth more than a lifetime of direct service, in that scenario?</span><br/><br/>People often say to "do whatever you're good at," and generally this advice makes sense. In a society where people largely agree on what matters and what needs to be done, specialization of this sort tends to lead to optimal outcomes. (In economics, this efficiency of markets can be rather exact because of a common unit of value.)<br/><br/>However, in cases where your values diverge from those of others or in which people fail to act rationally to achieve their values, market-like efficiency may not be present. This is true in many areas, even ones as concrete as, say, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dcp2.org/page/main/BrowseInterventions.html">public-health interventions</a>, where cost-effectiveness can vary by orders of magnitude.<br/><br/>As far as careers, take this silly example. Say you're really, really good at packing meat -- in fact, you can do it 1.5 as well as anyone else. Does this mean you should work at a meatpacking plant? Probably not, because you'll still be earning a lot less there than by being a really bad investment banker, lawyer, or doctor.<br/><br/>That said, I do think the "do what you're good at" and "do what you love" rules are <span style="font-style: italic">usually</span> not bad advice, especially within reason. It's true that trying to force yourself into a career you hate probably won't work in the long run and that, in general, you will tend to succeed more in careers you're good at. (That's other things being equal, of course, so there may be exceptions like the meatpacking one above.) Indeed, one of the nice things about the making-money option is precisely that it allows utilitarians a way to do what they love and are good at without needing to become utilitarian evangelists, activists, or researchers. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/><br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">If you want to do as much good as possible, here are some paths of life that I'd take seriously.  I'd break the kinds of jobs into three categories: get rich and give jobs, influence jobs, and research jobs.</span><br/><br/>I agree that those basically are the three viable options, in view of the <a class="postlink" href="../thread/170.html">high expected value of utilitarian research and meme-propagation</a>. I also strongly agree with everything else utilitymonster said, including the point that it's probably best to start out in the making-money track, because you can switch out of it much more easily than into it. Studying math, statistics, and computer science is also generally good advice for the same reason: Those skills allow you to work pretty much anywhere. In fact, because such degrees -- accurately or not -- are thought to signal ability, many finance and business employers prefer math majors over finance majors, especially quant shops on Wall Street.<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">It seems to me that one utilitarian can do only a little to improve the world but a utilitarian who can communicate utilitarianism to others can improve the world a lot.</span><br/><br/>I agree very much. There is usually an undervaluing of meme-spreading and an overvaluing of direct, tangible helping by society at large, for obvious psychological and signaling reasons. That said, if you can pay others to do the meme-spreading for you, that could be even better, depending on comparative advantage.<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">This relates to the traditional problem of "overdemandingness", though in a slightly different guise: it's not (only) that one is required to donate most of one's wealth; it's (also) that one is required to structure one's entire life so as to maximise the (donatable) wealth that one is expected to amass during one's lifetime.</span><br/><br/>Indeed. In fact, it was thinking about Singer's "drowning child" argument applied more broadly that prompted me to write the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/make-money.html">essay about making money</a> in the first place. If it's immoral to buy an expensive pair of shoes because you could have otherwise donated the money, then it's also immoral to take a job that pays less than you could be earning (again, other things being equal).<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">You could train yourself in ethics then teach it. You could write books about ethics like Peter Singer. You could try to cultivate a utilitarian sentiment among activists. You could have some kids and raise them to be altruistic.</span><br/><br/>I think the third of these options is probably best, perhaps followed by the first and/or second. The fourth seems rather costly, consider the high financial and time demands of raising children, unless you intend to do that anyway. In general, though, having children yourself is very expensive: You could influence a lot more people by donating to a research or meme-spreading organization. (Even if your goal is just to give children a good childhood and education, it's <span style="font-weight: bold">much</span> cheaper to do that by donating to, say, a school in India than by raising your own kids.)<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">You have to multiply the expected value of a career in x by the likelihood that you'll be interested enough to get going in x. Financial jobs aren't so lucrative (especially per working hour) that alternatives don't start to look better if you're convinced you'd enjoy them vs lukewarm about finance.</span><br/><br/>Agreed. I myself am guilty of not taking a long-hours, intensely stressful finance job in part because I couldn't force myself to do it -- instead, I work in a pretty-good-salary software job that I enjoy much more. Whether this is optimal or just selfish is debatable, I guess. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Thanks Arepo! So what do you guys think of international economic relief?

I like the economic perspective because of the whole "Give a man a fish, feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, feed him for a lifetime" aphorism.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

The bit about sunk costs helped clear up my thinking about this issue. I started out as a math major but switched to music and psychology, neither of which is a lucrative field. In fact, I'll probably give up playing the piano (more or less) since it is time-consuming and doesn't help anybody much. Perhaps I'll brush up on my "maths," go to business school, and get a career in finance. But it's difficult to know what one is capable of.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">That's a fair question, but I don't think that this would be contributing to the problem. The idea that bankers get paid too much is a socialist idea, rather than a utilitarian one. I don't think paying bankers more detracts from others' happiness really. I think that utilitarians shouldn't believe in 'closing the gap' between rich and poor. We should believe in lifting the income of the poor to alleviate their suffering. But in principle, there's no problem with bankers earning large amounts of money from a utilitarian perspective.<br/><br/>The problem is the richest people donate a smaller percentage of their income than middle-class people. That's what we need to change. How could we do that? We need to infiltrate the culture of the upper classes. We're not going to fix the problem by hating rich people. We'd be better served to gain wealth, to associate with rich people, to enter the upper class, to be a good role model, and to bring about a change from the inside.<br/><br/>I've set a good foundation by studying medicine. You're young, and you can do it too!<br/>You might also find this useful: <a class="postlink" href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/18424?in=40:34&amp;out=45:23">Peter Singer mentions the topic</a></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2"><span style="font-weight: bold">I invoke the spirit of LadyMorgana to resurrect this thread.</span> (Should I start a new thread? Mods - it's your decision)<br/><br/>Those of you who have a vague idea of who I am will know that I'm an 18 year old first year student studying philosophy at Oxford Brookes. My skills are mostly in philosophy. I got decent A-Levels (BBB). I'm average at maths and haven't studied it for 3+ years. I will give better descriptions if asked.<br/><br/>I want to become a professional philanthropist putting a minimum of 10% of my income to reducing the probability of existential risks - hopefully more than 10%, but we'll see. This is because it seems obvious that my comparative advantage probably doesn't fall into the area of working directly on x-risks or influencing other people - so <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/make-money.html">make money</a> is the best option for me.<br/><br/>So, I have a series of questions and discussion topics. I'm hoping that people can a) offer me valuable advice and b) learn from my experiences. I aim to document references and resources used and so on, so that others may follow in my footsteps - if they so wish.<br/><br/>I've consulted the <a class="postlink" href="http://highimpactcareers.org/">High Impact Careers</a> people (which means I spoke to Will Crouch). He says research is ongoing - and they aren't sure when the section of their website devoted to <a class="postlink" href="http://highimpactcareers.org/career-research">career research</a> will be up. He aims to put me in touch with Carl Schulman. He seemed to approve of my preliminary plan to do a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.allaboutlaw.co.uk/index.html/non-law/conversion-courses/">Law conversion</a> at the end of my degree and thereafter pursue corporate law or something. It was suggested that I try out computer programming and become a software engineer. I aim to check out the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.xrisknetwork.com/">Existential Risk Reduction Career Network</a>. I will update this paragraph when I get more information, and post as much personal communication as is permitted and required.<br/>Resources I've looked at: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wetfeet.com/">wetfeet</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm">glassdoor</a> (will ask for employment details, but set browser not to accept cookies and this is no longer a problem) and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.prospects.ac.uk/careers.htm">prospects</a>.<br/><br/>So, my questions/discussion points are:<br/><ul><li>What careers earn the most?</li><li>What careers have income scale up the fastest?

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2">Hi Gedusa,<br/><br/>Wow, you're only 18? I didn't even learn what the word "utilitarian" meant until I was 18. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/><br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Gedusa wrote:</cite>I want to become a professional philanthropist putting a minimum of 10% of my income to reducing the probability of existential risks<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Hmm, I'm not sure if I support that.  <img alt=":?" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif"/>  But I'll offer a reply anyway.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Gedusa wrote:</cite>It was suggested that I try out computer programming and become a software engineer.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>I think that's a good option, but part of the reason is that I haven't tried the other options. Software has the special advantage that, unlike law or medicine or MBA-level business, you don't need to sink lots of money into a degree that will only pay off years down the road. This is a more important consideration if you expect your plans to change, or if you expect to continue making money only for a few years rather than until you get old. My only-partially-informed impression is that software salaries start high but level off sooner than for longer-term professions.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Gedusa wrote:</cite>What careers can be done fairly easily with a Philosophy Degree from an average university? (or a simple conversion course)<br/></div></blockquote><br/>I guess the obvious ones are law and investment banking. Business, too, I suppose. Programming at startups if you know the technology. There are likely many of which I'm unaware.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Gedusa wrote:</cite>What careers have the greatest income variance? (I guess what I'm asking is which have the highest median income)<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Median or mean? If you don't care about risk (you may or may not, depending on what you plan to do with the money), then you would aim to maximize the mean.<br/><br/>The two highest are probably startups and Wall Street (both in terms of mean and variance, actually).<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Gedusa wrote:</cite>Is the value of a philosophy degree so low to someone in my position that I should change it? (fairly important)<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Hmm. It depends on how much <span style="font-style: italic">you</span> get out of the degree. Thinking about these big questions is extremely valuable -- worth many years of lost income. (Indeed, if you neglected them, made money, and then donated to something harmful, that would be worse than not donating at all.) However, studying philosophy as a degree may or may not be the best way to do this thinking. I took just one philosophy course in college, with most of my courses in math, statistics, computer science, and economics, but then I spent much of my free time on philosophically relevant reading and discussion (by which I mean not necessarily studying Henry Sidgwick all day, but things like reading about animal welfare, talking with friends, participating in forums like the Old Felicifia, etc.).<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Gedusa wrote:</cite>Is there anything glaringly obvious I've missed?<br/></div></blockquote><br/>You covered most of it. One other previous thread I'll mention is "<a class="postlink" href="../thread/123.html">Donation Tax Deductions</a>," which discusses Donor Advised Funds and such.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2"><span style="font-weight: bold">I'm</span> surprised <span style="font-weight: bold">I</span> know what utilitarian means - but I don't really like to dwell on it too much, it makes me feel really abnormal.

And just think - if I become a highly successful *insert here* then I'll be able to donate to causes you consider valuable - if you convince me of their value. Or potentially I'll do really harmful things due to not being convinced. Hmmm. But thanks for erring on the side of being helpful!<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Software has the special advantage that, unlike law or medicine or MBA-level business, you don't need to sink lots of money into a degree that will only pay off years down the road.

I don't really expect my plans to change, otherwise I would've changed them already - and I don't expect to be earning money until I'm old - so quick scaling up is important.<br/><br/>Law is currently top of my list. Investment banking is lower - I think that's because I perceive it as difficult to get into and not enjoyable - though I'm deducing all this from my brain basically saying: <span style="font-style: italic">"Investment banking - ewww".</span> <br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Median or mean? If you don't care about risk (you may or may not, depending on what you plan to do with the money), then you would aim to maximize the mean.</div></blockquote><br/>I was talking about median - but now I'm intrigued. Bear in mind that I'm not a perfect altruist - so diminishing marginal utility of money still implies risk-adversity for money spent on myself. What altruistic uses of money imply risk-adversity? I will have to think about this more... I was originally meaning that if two careers had the same mean income but one had a higher median income, then I should go for the higher median one. However I recognize that that's utterly artificial, careers with the highest income have the highest variance as you say.<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Thinking about these big questions is extremely valuable -- worth many years of lost income. (Indeed, if you neglected them, made money, and then donated to something harmful, that would be worse than not donating at all.)</div></blockquote><br/>Yes this is true. I don't think a philosophy degree is very valuable for this purpose though - the course doesn't always prioritize the sorts of questions I'm interested in. I get a whole ton of my philosophy stuff from Less Wrong these days, though that doesn't (yet) give me a complete picture. All in all I'm not really sure about this sort of thing - I'm still inclined to dive headlong into a high-paying career and think about the issues as I go... With the thought that once I'm in the good career I can switch donation destinations, but if I waste time now I might never get into a good career - or I will have less time to scale up income before *insert disaster here* happens.<br/><br/>Donor Advised Funds do seem to be a useful way to simply avoid tax and make sure I can't rise above a certain level of selfishness. I think they'd be useful enough that I might use them, but I'd have to do more research. At the moment though, none of my income is taxed because my income is so low - so I'm worrying about scaling up my income until tax does become a problem!</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

It's hard to make a start-up without funds and it's hard to switch professions without financial stability. For maximum funds, I'd imagine you're looking at finance, business or law. But that's a general impression, not an evidence-based opinion and it's for Australia not England. I think we're all depending on Will Crouch and High Impact Careers to give us some hard evidence here.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2"><blockquote><div><cite>Gedusa wrote:</cite>Hmmm.

I also think I would be pretty bad at it -- doing salesmanship and making deals -- but maybe that's just an excuse. A bad investment banker still earns more than people at the top of their professions in many other fields.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Gedusa wrote:</cite>What altruistic uses of money imply risk-adversity?<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Well, I think I might be mildly risk-averse to the extent that my future plans may involve living off my savings while I work on wild-animal suffering. I don't need millions of dollars to do that.<br/><br/>In theory, it ought to be possible to eliminate risk aversion among utilitarians. Given sufficient numbers, they could all promise to contribute to an "insurance" fund that would pay out regardless of whether or not they hit the jackpot at their startups. People who made more than expected would pay more to the fund. Needless to say, this would create pretty bad <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard">moral hazard</a> unless the utilitarians all agreed completely on what they should do with the money so that they wouldn't mind paying out.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Gedusa wrote:</cite>With the thought that once I'm in the good career I can switch donation destinations, but if I waste time now I might never get into a good career<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Yes, I think that's the best argument.

I've talked with dozens of people about high-paying careers (including many people on Wall Street), and this seems to be the consensus. Salaries posted in job searches indicate the same. The SIAI crowd is strongly convinced that startups have perhaps the highest expected returns of all.<br/><br/>You might try Google Scholar searches to find more. I've done some research in the past showing that "entrepreneurs" often have lower expected earnings than people in conventional jobs. But these studies didn't separate restaurant owners from tech-company founders. I would guess the average is higher for startups if you include the Peter Thiels, Mark Zuckerbergs, etc. in the calculation.<br/><br/>You could also visit Glassdoor.com, although that won't help much with the startups.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>RyanCarey wrote:</cite>But that's a general impression, not an evidence-based opinion<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Hard to say which is better. A few real-life data points given by friends may be more valuable than thousands of numbers from studies, because the study estimates may be systematically biased due to lacking the full picture. Of course, asking friends can also be biased if the sample is unrepresentative.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

The figure is for start-ups that receive VC funding. I don't know what percentage of start-ups manage to do so, but it's probably well under 100%. In addition, there is doubtless a lot of self-selection. The people who found start-ups are probably smarter, more motivated, and more creative than the average programmer. So it's not clear whether a career in programming is the best bet for people (like me) who have little or no experience. I do hope that the High-Impact Careers people provide some information about this, since I'm spending ~3 hours a day learning programming. (One of them pointed me to that study.)<br/><br/>It would be nice to know how much of start-up success is due to skills vs. how much is due to luck. Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Steve Jobs seem pretty smart, and if the bar is set that high, I'd abandon all hope. I also wonder if the start-up route would mean moving to California. I use <a class="postlink" href="https://www.rememberthemilk.com">Remember the Milk</a>, which was developed by Australians, but my impression is that it would easier to get VC funding in the U.S. So willingness to relocate might be an important factor.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="3">Thanks for the source, Pat.<br/><br/>The $5.8 million figure is interesting. But I've thought about it, and the more I do so, the less impressive it becomes. Here is an outline for how this figure could be deflated. Suppose that the overwhelming majority of startups do not attract venture capital and those that do not are far less profitable. This would make the profitability of startups perhaps $2 million. Then, suppose that running a startup involves 80+ hours of work per week for two years. Then, the startup owner is getting paid $1 million for one year of double-hours work. Now, consider that the startup owners are on average highly intelligent and charismatic. They would be expected to earn a lot anyway. The income from a startup has massive year-to-year variance, so you'll have to set aside significant savings or take out insurance.<br/><br/>Excuse my amateurish guesses, I'm just trying to convey a general approach.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

A group of five students manning pizza tables for an hour could typically raise something like $100 after subtracting off pizza costs. Beyond this, however, there were costs to plan the event, reserve space in the school lobby, remind the other group members to participate, order the pizza, leave class a few minutes early to set up, clean up after the sale, and coordinate deposition of the funds into the club's school account. Generously, this might have amounted to, say, $10 per hour of student time. One of the students in the club had a father who earned probably $50-$100 an hour.

We held several events to solicit donations, including a dance party and a walkathon.

It would have been so much easier if those people had decided to donate the money and be done with it, rather than having a dozen students go through hoops to coordinate activities. Of course, the conventional response might be that "fundraising events serve a broader purpose than raising money -- they also contribute to a sense of community." Sure, that's fine.

Soon after, I stumbled upon Peter Singer and read much the same argument in "Famine, Affluence, and Morality" and <span style="font-style: italic">Practical Ethics</span>. Singer makes a big point about not wasting money on good shoes, but he doesn't talk as much about wasted opportunities to make money for donation. (The reason he doesn't makes sense: Most people have stronger intuitions about actions, like buying expensive shoes, than inactions, like failing to make more money. So the drowning-pond argument goes through better.)<br/><br/>Also once I discovered Singer, I learned that animals could suffer -- via "<a class="postlink" href="http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/singer03.htm">Do Animals Feel Pain?</a>" on <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian.net/">utilitarian.net</a>.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="9">Besides (perhaps) having high expected earnings because of start-ups, programming might be more future-proof than most other high-earning careers. The financial sector in general is in a precarious position. Many economists believe that (at least in the U.S.) it is too large for the economy's good. And much of the public believes that shuffling money between corporations and rich people contributes much value to society. If the government puts a tax on financial transactions, or passes stricter regulations, a career in the financial sector could become less lucrative.<br/><br/>A couple of articles in Slate argued that <a class="postlink" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/robot_invasion/2011/09/will_robots_steal_your_job_2.html">pharmacists</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/robot_invasion/2011/09/will_robots_steal_your_job_3.html">medical specialists</a> are vulnerable to automation and greater efficiency due to technological progress. (The author made the same case for <a class="postlink" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/robot_invasion/2011/09/will_robots_steal_your_job_5.html">lawyers</a>, but he seemed less convincing there.)<br/><br/>In the future, programmers might be vulnerable to competition from India and China. Right now, most of the work done by those countries is low-end, uninteresting stuff. I haven't heard of any Indian tech start-ups that created products popular in the developed world, but maybe that will change. But soon after computers start programming themselves in interesting ways, either we'll be dead or we'll enter some transcendental technological utopia.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Have people suggested it?</div></blockquote><br/>According to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2011/wp1154.pdf">a paper from the IMF</a>, a tax on financial transactions has been advocated for by Keynes, Joseph Stiglitz, and Larry Summers. The goal of such a tax would be to curb speculation and compensate the government for taking on the risk of potential failures of financial institutions. I suppose the tax would affect quantitative analysts and hedge-fund managers more than investment bankers.<br/><br/>I read two memoirs of people's experiences as investment bankers (<span style="font-style: italic">The Accidental Investment Banker</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">Monkey Business</span>) to help me decide whether it was something I could do. The authors of both books believed that the fees charged by banks were too high given the value of their services. The fact that the banks have continued to make a lot of money in the decade since the books were published might mean that the authors were mistaken, or that for whatever reason banks are immune from the pressures of competition.<br/><br/>My main point is that the high-earning careers of tomorrow might be different from those of today. But if you discount your future earnings enough (because of the social rate of return on charitable donations), your salary in thirty years doesn't figure much in your decision about what career to pursue. My discount rate isn't so high, though, because I'm not convinced I'd give the money to the right organization, and the returns on information can greatly exceed the social rate of return (Alan mentioned this in another post).<br/><br/>These are the organizations I've given to, in chronological order: my church, the Sierra Club, the Nature Conservancy, Unicef, the Humane Society of the United States, Population Services International, Vegan Outreach, the SIAI. The expected value of the organizations I've chosen to donate to seems to have increased. A counterargument might be that I've already given to the most effective charity, and that even if I divided my money evenly between, for example, GiveWell, Vegan Outreach, and the SIAI, I'd do more good than if I waited twenty years and gave it to the most effective organization (because of the social rate of return).</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I don't think i-banks have a mono/olig-opoly, yet the employees command higher income than practically anyone else on earth. Maybe it's risk. Or maybe the job requires the absolute smartest people, who can then demand high pay. I suppose you could ask why top lawyers earn so much, too.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Pat wrote:</cite>even if I divided my money evenly between, for example, GiveWell, Vegan Outreach, and the SIAI, I'd do more good than if I waited twenty years and gave it to the most effective organization (because of the social rate of return).</div></blockquote><br/>Could be, depending on the social rate of return. Of course, it would have higher expected value to give now to what you think is the single best of them -- rather than splitting among the three -- though this carries the risk that your entire life would be wasted, which might be more psychologically burdensome.<br/><br/>Of course, you might very well not yet have found the cause that's better than all of them by orders of magnitude.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="9">Update: Still mainly thinking of Law. Uncertain still on whether to change degree to Law as opposed to continuing philosophy and doing a Law conversion course. Banking, programming still on the table. No new ideas.<br/><br/>Investment banking biographies are now on my reading list. Anyone know any exciting books about life as a corporate lawyer? <img alt=":P" src="../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif"/><br/><br/>Startups are interesting - though they mainly seem to be tech related, and these generally require programming skills to work at/start - or am I missing something? I'm going through Khan Academy's videos on programming though, so it's possible I will be able to do that sort of thing/become a software engineer.<br/><br/>I too shy from vast amounts of work and stress. And intuitively I flee from high risk - high reward ventures. My brain screams "gambling" and "gambling=stupid" and makes me run away. I might be able to deal with it though - honestly I've never been under huge stress for longer than a day or two, so I have no idea how I'd cope. <br/><br/>@ Ruiari: I generally regard politics as highly unlikely to be changed due to the actions of an individual actor - given that the system has enormous institutional inertia. And if you wanted to change the world via politics - I still wouldn't want you to become a politician. Lobbyists probably influence policy quite a lot - a utilitarian lobby funded by a rich utilitarian would have better effects than one utilitarian politician. As for careers in influencing - this really depends on your skills. A rich banker would certainly have some influence if they gave a lot of stuff away. Journalism is pretty cut-throat from what I hear - not a lot of capacity to write stories in a way you want until you're in the upper echelons - unless you start your own media company to promote utilitarian ideals or something.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="9"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>But surely you want to look at the expected value?</div></blockquote><br/>Yes. I should be looking at the expected value and making decisions based on that but irrational forces in my brain start to have other ideas. That's probably the reason I don't like those sorts of ventures - not anything rational.<br/><br/>Hmm. I'm still skeptical of how much difference the politician would make. They'd probably just be seen as weird or something. An altruistic banker might be pretty good, ditto for most high earning professions. You might have better luck in professions where others of your profession are already predisposed to altruistic or more rational behaviour or something.. Honestly, I have nothing to say on the subject that you won't have heard already - I suggest maybe contacting High Impact Careers? <br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>There must be some value to diversifying within the util community - not so much for safety of income as because if you're providing a high-value service, you can also gain by offering it for free to people who share your worldview/goals.</div></blockquote><br/>This would be if only utilitarians would agree on things that they think are best to do! Otherwise I have less incentive to offer free services. <img alt=":P" src="../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif"/><br/>And I'm still skeptical of the extent to which this would be helpful in the real world. Lawyers could provide free legal services for utilitarians, but if they sacrifice a career as an investment banker to do so it seems like they've made a bad choice. Ditto for many other choices. Sure, if income were the same between two careers, and most utilitarians were one career - then you should go for the less populated career - but that rarely happens.<br/><br/>You also seem to suppose that we couldn't all just contribute to a general fund of some kind - for use on high value services. This would mean it wouldn't matter at all which career most of us were in - except for purposes of diversification between different fields.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="9">There is considerable variance in incomes of Lawyers it's true. If we take corporate Law (and I would intend to) then figures are best out of the U.S. - where a starting salary can be around $125,000 for a junior corporate lawyer - or it can be as low as $40,000. This tends to go nuts if you turn out to be good - salaries up much higher than that are semi-common. I'm not sure how the recession has hurt lawyers (if at at all). Wikipedia claims starting salary is something like $65,000 - rising to $95,000 in 5 yrs and $140,000 after 10-15 yrs. <br/><br/>In essence: Average wages in the UK for Law are higher than most other professions. There tends to be a cluster of wages above £60,000 but below £100,000. If you're really good then you'll break that £100,000 barrier, if you're crap - no one will hire you. (IMO - based on my research). And of course I think I'd enjoy Law more than banking or whatever - though that is definitely an area in which the value of new information is high. <br/><br/>I have no real idea how good I'll be. Realistically - it would seem like I'd be in the upper-middle of the cluster of wages. I'm still considering banking though!<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to their careers research too! I have no idea about startups being V.C. backed - nor do I have any idea how to find this out (sorry!).</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="9"><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>what other areas do you guys think would have high amounts of influence?  journalism?<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Probably most of what it takes to get influence is to actively seek it, e.g., by writing to the general public, holding talks, participating in media events, etc. Activist groups do lots of publicity like this. Your specific private career may not matter too much compared with your extent of outreach efforts and charisma, although career may matter a little bit in terms of bestowing initial credibility. (E.g., a neuroscientist would be taken more seriously than a poet when talking about insect suffering.)<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>do you guys think is it likely that you would get publicity as a rich banker who gives a lot of their money away?<br/></div></blockquote><br/>I bet a banker could get a good amount of publicity with a little work. Bill Gates and Warren Buffet have gotten a lot of attention. Of course, you'd almost certainly be less wealthy than they, but the smaller players probably can get good press as well.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I believed (and still think it's probably true) that lobbying was a more cost-effective way to advance those causes but that it was underfunded because people preferred visible, short-term impacts. <span style="font-style: italic">Bread for the World</span> has some statistic to the effect that if you divide the international aid given by Congress by the number of letters that people wrote to their Congressmen/women about the issue, it amounts to thousands of dollars per letter. And Bread for the World can gather hundreds of letters at a single event. Of course, letters to Congress probably comprise a small portion of the total causal contribution to the aid, but even after you adjust for that, it's pretty impressive.<br/><br/>The trouble with things like wild-animal suffering is that they could never even enter the political arena without decades more legwork persuading people to take them seriously. So for these we need to start with meme spreading at the intellectual level. That said, maybe encouraging governments to spend more on insect-suffering research is plausible (since they already fund a fair portion of it).</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I would guess that income accounts for a tiny fraction (&lt;10%) of the total impact you would have as a politician. However, it also seems extremely difficult to become more than a local politician.<br/><br/>If the goal is to enter politics to spread memes, what kinds of memes would you want to spread? It may be easier to spread memes outside of politics, because many of them -- e.g., wild animals, insect pain, etc. -- would be laughed at by most constituents. As you suggest, you could be a really great ordinary politician and then publicize these wacky views after people have grown to trust you, but I'm not sure it's worth the wait, and I don't know if it would have a substantially more positive impact than starting out with the memes you believe in.<br/><br/>If you enjoy and are good at politics, it could very well be an optimal choice in your case. But I think that would be <span style="font-style: italic">because</span> you enjoy it and are good at it. I don't know if it's inherently one of the best options (though I haven't studied it at length).</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="10">to explain about memes and stuff a bit more clearly (but please disagree if you think other things are a better idea)<br/> <br/>i think inspiring more poeple to be and/or think like utilitirians is a really effecitive thing to do.<br/><br/>the ways ive been thinking of doing this is by<br/><br/>1) promoting either utilitarianism iself or similar more socially acceptable ideas<br/><br/>and/or<br/><br/>2) by getting invertebrate pain nresearch done and if it turns out theyc an suffer and we play it right hopefully utilitarisnism could get real famous and lotsa vegetarians might become utilitarian.<br/><br/>yea basically what im thinking is that i can get rich and fund leaflets and lectures and stuff or i could go into politics and talk about what one might call the "softer" (more socially acceptable) utilitarian issues and fund them too (poverty, factory farming maybe a little possibility of insect suffering, im hopefull given that Elwood is supervising several phds in the invertebrate pain area studies which are government funded). this is kinda the way i think of peter singer, i remember reading that when asked about eco system redesign he didnt think interfering in nature was a good idea at all but hes making utilitarianism famous and once people have the central idea hopefully some will extrapolate and come to eco system redesign type conclusions, if i did go into politics though i wouldnt talk about eco system redeisgn or AI or stuff like that.<br/><br/>i might do a degree in agricultural science and then try and get elected,<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>My impression is that, even though politicians earn a lot more than most people, they earn less than most people at their skill level, and relative to the effort they put in. I would guess that income accounts for a tiny fraction (&lt;10%) of the total impact you would have as a politician. However, it also seems extremely difficult to become more than a local politician.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>could you explain what you mean more please?, i think maybe you guys see this as quite different to me because you live in bigger countries with big populatins, i think theres only about 5 million here, i dont wanna sound even more niave than usually but it just really doesnt look that difficult. a lot of the politicians here say exactly the same things, it just becomes a big popularity contest. i think maybe the reason im thinking it migth be great is because im quite charismatic, not that thats bad <img alt=":D" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif"/><br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I bet a banker could get a good amount of publicity with a little work.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="10"><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>2) by getting invertebrate pain nresearch done<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Well, you know I love that suggestion. <img alt=";)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif"/><br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>and if it turns out theyc an suffer and we play it right hopefully utilitarisnism could get real famous and lotsa vegetarians might become utilitarian.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>I don't think the invertebrate-pain research would do a lot on its own to promote utilitarianism. But you're right that, coupled with proper PR, it could change hearts and minds, especially about questions like how much suffering occurs in nature.<br/><br/>You suggested the analogy with Peter Singer. Animal welfare isn't inherently connected with utilitarianism, but Singer has made utilitarianism more famous, including in vegetarian circles, through his writings and lectures. <br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>im hopefull given that Elwood is supervising several phds in the invertebrate pain area studies which are government funded)<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Yep, or others like him. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/><br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>i might do a degree in agricultural science and then try and get elected,<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Interesting path. Do you known anyone else who has done that? I'm not sure how funding works, but it's possible that some of it is decided by the executive bureaucracy rather than the legislature, in which case it could help to be a civil servant? Or maybe a researcher who gives advice to government agencies? I don't know any details, so it would be interesting to ask people who know more.

Also, you'd develop a network of colleagues and might be able to encourage them to think more about insects. There's probably some agricultural scientist out there who's interested in studying insect welfare and humane killing of pests but who isn't pursuing it; maybe you could find him/her and spur him/her to work on it.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="10"><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>a lot of our politicians are former teachers,<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Amazing. Like, professors, or grade-school teachers? I don't know if I've ever heard of a teacher running for Congress in the US.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>if someone was specifically interested in studying invertebrate suffering it probably wouldnt be the field for them<br/></div></blockquote><br/>True. I guess I was thinking of the "humane insecticides" side of the story. Probably ~1/4 of the entomologists at agriculture schools focus their research on pest control, so there's no dearth of expertise in those departments, at least.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>is there much low hanging fruit in the area of fishing? as in are there any easy implented things that could really reduce suffering here? well first we gotta establish if they can suffer or not...</div></blockquote><br/>After insects, I would guess that fish and chicken are the lowest hanging in terms of gains from humane slaughter, because there are so many of them compared with cows and pigs. Also, <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humane_Slaughter_Act#Criticism_of_the_HMSLA">poultry and fish aren't protected by the Humane Slaughter Act</a> in the US the way mammals are supposed to be. I'm not sure if the number of fish slaughtered is higher or lower than for chickens, but it's of the same order of magnitude. From "<a class="postlink" href="http://animaldeathcount.blogspot.com/">Number of Animals Killed for Food</a>":<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>In 2009, the average American meat eater was responsible for about 198 deaths:<br/>1/7 of a cow<br/>2/5 of a pig<br/>1 turkey<br/>1½ chickens for eggs<br/>25 chickens for meat<br/>40 fish<br/>130 shellfish<br/></div></blockquote><br/>According to that measure, there are more fish killed than chickens, but a later section says<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Slaughter Statistics<br/>The number of animals slaughtered in the US comprise only a portion of the total number that die here, as many do not reach the slaughterhouse. Neither do they include animals slaughtered abroad and then shipped to the US, even as they do include those slaughtered here for sale abroad. Nevertheless, they provide a picture of the slaughter industry in this country. The 2009 slaughter included:<br/>22,767,000 ducks<br/>34,467,800 cattle<br/>113,733,800 pigs<br/>245,768,000 turkeys<br/>8,658,860,000 chickens<br/>7.3 billion fish<br/>12 billion shellfish<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Here chickens slightly preponderate. Either chickens or fish would be a good bet, I guess. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/><br/><br/>I give ~0.85 probability to chickens being able to feel conscious suffering, and ~0.7 for fish. Say ~0.4 for insects. And ~0.96 for other people <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/> (due to solipsistic simulation scenarios). Those estimates are pulled out of thin air but are based on my memories of reading a good number of articles on these topics.<br/><br/>As far as methods of fish slaughter, I wrote most of the "<a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_farming#Slaughter_methods">Slaughter methods</a>" section of the Wikipedia article on fish farming. (As I've mentioned before, <a class="postlink" href="http://reducing-suffering.blogspot.com/2009/04/save-notes-to-wikipedia.html">contributing to Wikipedia</a> is an excellent way to raise awareness of utilitarian issues, because those articles have such a wide readership.)<br/><br/>Mercy for Animals has a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mercyforanimals.org/fish/">particularly poignant video</a> depicting catfish slaughter in one Texas facility.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>then the next election id be over the eligible age and out of my degree would be 2021<br/></div></blockquote><br/>I'm looking for the Ruairi '21 election campaign. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

For example, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/humane-insecticides.html">if there existed a program to pay farmers to use less painful insecticides</a>, it would likely be more cost-effective than Vegan Outreach in direct suffering prevented. This ignores wild-animal-suffering memes, although I think humane insecticides would be better for memes than VO, too.<br/><br/>Of course, the startup costs of such an operation would be high, but once set up, it would be extremely efficient. And paying farmers directly is probably less efficient in expected-value terms than lobbying or public outreach around the issue.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>RyanCarey wrote:</cite>It would seem silly to assign a 0.4% probability that one insect is equally sentient as one human.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>40% you mean?<br/><br/>Well, I'm not sure it's silly. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/><br/><br/>I don't know whether I weigh suffering by brain size. I probably do in some measure -- a worm cut in half isn't quite as bad as a human cut in half -- but I don't think it's proportional to number of neurons. I think insects get more weight than their share of neural tissue. It seems as though being a single agent with a unified conscious experience counts for more than the sum of its neural constituents.<br/><br/>If I had to take a stance, I would say that one consciously suffering human is as bad as, say, 5 consciously suffering worms, assuming that worms can suffer. Multiplying this by 0.4 probability for conscious suffering, then the actual exchange rate might be ~0.08.<br/><br/>By the way, do you think men deserve more moral weight because <a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Do_men_have_bigger_brains_than_women">they have bigger brains than women</a>?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<h3><a href="#p4397">Utilitarian Careers + Preaching Utilitarianism</a></h3>
<p class="author"><img alt="Post" height="9" src="../styles/nexus/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" title="Post" width="11"/>by <strong><a href="../user/53.html">RyanCarey</a></strong> on 2011-11-29T01:37:00</p>
<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="10">I agree that inspiring utilitarianism in others is optimal for many utilitarians. To me, that means we have to:<br/>1. get an audience<br/>2. deliver a credible message<br/><br/>So how big an audience should we aim for? You can get a small and unwilling audience by becoming a secondary school philosophy teacher, for example. If you become a researcher or a philosopher, you might have more success because your audience will extent beyond your own class to academics worldwide. If you are truly ambitious, you will tell me that you do not want to be merely an academic who is respected within his own field. You want to aim for something more like the level of recognition of Peter Singer or Sam Harris. What that means, is you have decided, as I think you should, that you want to become a <span style="font-weight: bold">public intellectual</span>.<br/><br/>To become a public intellectual, <span style="font-weight: bold">you need to write a really popular book</span>. For Peter Singer, that book was Animal Liberation. For Sam Harris, it was The End Of Faith. Peter Singer's publication was a founding work of antispeciesism. It presumably sold its first hundred copies on the back of his philosophical reputation. But it sold probably a hundred thousand more because it was a founding work of antispeciesism. Four years later, he wrote Practical Ethics, which applied preference utilitarianism to human ethics. Now think of Sam Harris. In 2004 Sam was thinking about the role of religion in our society. At this moment, three years after the September attacks, so were the American public. So were Dawkins, Hitchens and Dennett. Thus New Atheism was formed. Unlike Singer, he did not publish his book on the back of some qualification to talk about his topic. (I think he might have been about to start a PhD in neuroscience at the time). Rather, his success was because he was the first to apply such an incisive writing style to that popular sentiment of distrust for religion. Six years later, he wrote the Moral Landscape, which asked what morality would be possible for atheists.<br/><br/>So if you or I want to be a public intellectual, what book should we write? If a popular utilitarian emerged today, I think they would be a researcher in positive psychology. This field is massive at the moment, and it's spawning numerous best-sellers. It's relation to utilitarianism is obvious. Moreso than the link between atheism and morality, anyway. Will positive psychology still be such a force ten years from now? Maybe not. Could a neuroscientist who 'discovered' something about happiness enter the public arena in the near future? Who knows. That an insect biologist addressing the topic of insect sentience seems less likely to me. It seems to me that that's a profession that could only enter the public eye fifty or more years from now. But I'd be interested in your opinions.<br/><br/>Now, finally, to the second point. The credible message. Here, I think, I can add a missing piece to the puzzle, Ruairi. It is actually a misleading to say that credibility applies to the message alone. <span style="font-weight: bold">Credibility is, of course, as dependent on the messenger as on the message</span>. Someone who wants to persuade others has to be affable. If you want to persuade someone, by definition, they already don't like what you're going to say. So you are unlikely to have success if they already don't like you either! But credibility doesn't just depend on personal characteristics, it also depends on personal behaviour.<br/><br/>Think of Toby Ord donating half of his salary to charity. He donates half his income to charity. Because he lead by example, his message was credible. Because his behaviour was <span style="font-weight: bold">authentic</span> So much so that he has been published in newspapers across the world, signing up thousands of members to follow in his footsteps. If Toby Ord had merely told people what to do without making such a sacrifice, what would the response have been? He would not have been published once. There would be no story of significance to publish. He would have been regarded as a hypocrite. So, <span style="font-weight: bold">to effectively inspire utilitarianism, we have to be utilitarian ourselves</span>. There are detailed questions to be aske here about how we should divide our time across these topics. I'll leave those unanswered. But what I will say is that the public could easily understand that a neuroscientist who is researching invertebrate sentience is doing his best to find out what suffering is so that we can minimise it.<br/><br/>So my current thoughts on a utilitarian life is that we should aim to inspire utilitarianism in others. <br/>Let's research utilitarian topics. Let's donate what money we have left-over. Let's make sure to stay as friendly (happy) people. Then, let's judge the intellectual environment to decide what needs to be said. Then, let's write a book on that topic, preferably using our expertise. Let's try again and again until we write a book that succeeds. Then, let's use that publicity, along with our personal characteristics and authentic behaviour to promote utilitarianism.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="10">Great questions, Ruairi.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>become a university neuroscience professor --&gt;<br/> do research + supervise several phds in areas in high impact area + reasonably big salary (€100,000?) --&gt;<br/> when its discovered that invertebrates can suffer start a movement out of it promoting humane pesticides and make utilitarianism really famous from this!:D!<br/></div></blockquote><br/>I quite like that path, but mainly because I think it'll be good for the insects. I don't think it'll do more for utilitarianism than many other things you could work on. But you may as well do good things while promoting utilitarianism, to kill two birds with one stone.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>but what i just said is pretty optimistic!<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Yeah. €100K sounds like a lot for the salary of that type of professor, unless you know otherwise.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>id imagine researching these topics it'll be hard to get funding for phds<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Right. That part is a potential roadblock. <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_A._Lockwood">Jeffrey Lockwood</a> suggested to me that there's very little funding for research on insect pain in a pure sense.<br/><br/>Another professor said that he can study mechanisms of pain in invertebrates only because invertebrates are model organisms for what happens in people. But maybe you could get those kinds of grants and then put your own spin on the results as far as their relevance to insect suffering.<br/><br/>And apparently Elwood has funding from somewhere, so maybe it's not impossible to find.<br/><br/>More general funding sources are better, because that money wouldn't otherwise have gone toward insect-suffering research. If there's a very specific grant to study whether insects can suffer, then the fact that you get it means someone else won't.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>then again if im just a banker and not the actual scientist doing the research would i not really be in a position to educate people on the topic?  does it matter?  could i just pay people to do it?<br/></div></blockquote><br/>It might take some searching, but I bet you could eventually find at least one person who's not now studying the topic but who would do so if given a grant. S/he might not have the same degree of passion that you do, though.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>i think 80,000 hours say on their site a banker might earn £200,000 a year (€232,000)<br/></div></blockquote><br/>That's probably pretty hard to achieve as well (just like becoming a well known professor is), so keep in mind that both of these are optimistic estimates. However, the comparison should still be valid.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>then for it to be more high impact to be a banker id have to be able to fund several neuroscientists for €132,000 (bankers salary minus professors salary) it seems unlikely to be possible if i was to actually pay their salaries, but if i was to fund phds? would this be possible? does anyone know around how much it would cost?<br/></div></blockquote><br/>I'm not sure. Grad students are cheaper.<br/><br/>Banker vs. professor is a tough decision, and I don't know which way to go. However, the good thing is that this is a "dilemma of riches," so to speak, in that either one of these would be a great choice. It's hard to decide because they're both compelling.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>but really i think focusing on inspiring others to be utilitarian is best because of how high impact this is.</div></blockquote><br/>Of course, you could do that to some extent as a banker or professor, but I guess you're suggesting an alternative could be to do that full-time?<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>you say something in positive psychology would be good but while humans being happy is really important a lot of people are already working on this and its really just not as big a problem as other things, other things where much larger gains can be made. basically id be worried the link isnt actually that strong, and that id influence people to build strong communities and stuff, which is fantastic! but they'll still be eating factory farmed animals and not thinking of invertebrates.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>I couldn't agree more.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>RyanCarey wrote:</cite>So if you or I want to be a public intellectual, what book should we write? If a popular utilitarian emerged today, I think they would be a researcher in positive psychology. This field is massive at the moment, and it's spawning numerous best-sellers. It's relation to utilitarianism is obvious. Moreso than the link between atheism and morality, anyway. Will positive psychology still be such a force ten years from now? Maybe not. Could a neuroscientist who 'discovered' something about happiness enter the public arena in the near future? Who knows. That an insect biologist addressing the topic of insect sentience seems less likely to me. It seems to me that that's a profession that could only enter the public eye fifty or more years from now. But I'd be interested in your opinions.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>I'm wary of spending years on a project that we find suboptimal (like positive psychology) just to gather public recognition. As Ruairi suggested, if we need recognition, it might be better to convince others to promote our cause. Plus, the odds of becoming Sam Harris are really low, so on average, it may be that an insect scientist accomplishes as much as a someone who tries to become a public intellectual.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>i could keep mentioning utilitarianism loads but then i might aswell be any kind of famous person and talk/write about utilitarianism, if this seems optimal it would seem like something we should try and get someone already famous to do it.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Yeah, getting famous isn't easy, because lots of people are trying to do that.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>did peter singer already have an interested audience or did he really start something from the begining? if the latter then id be more hopefull it could happen with invertebrates too.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>I think he started from the ground up, but he probably just got lucky. There are loads of other philosophers in his position whom no one has heard of. This isn't to say that being like Singer is a bad idea but just that your odds of success are much lower than they might seem by looking at his case alone.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>has peter singers work?<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Singer has had more of an impact than a hundred people like me put together. But Bill Gates earned more than a hundred other company founders. Neither is representative of the most likely outcome. (Still, they do drag up the expected value.)</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Particularly I'm looking at academia, law and finance (oh and maybe being a (rescue helicopter:D) pilot if the wages are high).<br/><br/>There’s lots of stuff online but I don’t know what’s reliable (the stuff on payscale often only seems to have around 50 people as its sample).<br/><br/>Also that’s just the career average, I really don't know how to assess if I’m smart enough (although maybe one can look just compare the average for all careers? doesn't seem very good), but I thought of one possible way; <br/><br/>As regards breaking into i banking what I hear/read is that the economics and finance course in university college Dublin (UCD) is the most useful course for getting into i banking. Last year the minimum "points" (grades) needed to get onto the course was 480, statistics online tell me this puts everyone on the course in the top 12.5% and up of the country academically.<br/><br/>I got in touch (do people who arn't Irish use this saying? just means contacted) with a few people at UCD regarding how many of the econ. and finance graduates break into banking each year, the people I contacted didn't have any statistics on how many graduates break into i banking from the course but they assured me graduates do break in. The clearest answer I got was that "probably more than one graduate would break in but less than 5" (the way he said it makes me want to say much less than 5). There are 20 places on the course each year.<br/><br/>They were always talking about banks in London (that they're graduates got into) it seemed. I dunno if this is less attractive or anything but seemed important to mention.<br/><br/>So I was thinking if i divide 12.5 by 10 (if we say maybe the top two graduates from each year get into i banking) then maybe one would need to be around the top 1.25% academically?<br/><br/>But this is just breaking in, it’s "up or out" so perhaps you'd need to be smarter again to make considerable amounts of money? Then again there's money to be made if you are "out" too.<br/><br/>Also I doubt many (or maybe any, but really I don’t know) of the graduates on the course got the grades to be in the top 1.25% of the country academically, but that doesn’t mean they arn't, quite likely that they just didn’t bother because of the extra study they would have to do.<br/><br/>I hear exams systems in other countries are different (and better) but here it's largely a big memory test, questions are repeated again and again, in English you are supposed to study 6 poets but often people will study less because there is a pattern to which ones come up on the exam paper. So if someone didn’t need the grades they were capable of for the course they wanted I think its very likely they might just study less hard.<br/><br/>As regards academia I think science was actually 480 points as well last year, then after your second year you decide what science to do your degree in, you will only get into the more sought after sciences (neuroscience being one of them) if you are doing well academically, and then after that it seems likely to have a shot at academia one needs to get a good degree, probably a first?? So at the moment I'm trying to find out what percentage of graduates get firsts and then do the same thing as above. But of course, as above, this doesn’t account for career progression or anything.<br/><br/>Any ideas how to do all this better please???<br/><br/>Finally if I want to I can try and get an internship in trinity college with a neuroscience academic sometime this summer, don't really know exactly what this entails but basically I'd get to shadow them and learn about stuff. But if I'm not gonna do neuroscience it seems like a waste of time, I might need to apply soon though, any thoughts on if I should go for it?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="5"><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>There’s lots of stuff online but I don’t know what’s reliable (the stuff on payscale often only seems to have around 50 people as its sample).<br/></div></blockquote><br/>I know what you mean about not knowing what numbers to trust. It's not the sample size that's the problem (50 is way more than enough to get a reasonable estimate); the problem is that you don't know the demographic information  behind the people in that average (e.g., their percentile academically within the general population, their work ethic, hours worked, drive to make money, etc.). Carl <a class="postlink" href="http://80000hours.org/blog/24-5-ways-to-be-misled-by-salary-rankings">mentioned some other problems</a> with the raw salary averages, many of which you just explained as well.<br/><br/>What to do? You can try to get estimates from several different angles and see how well they hold together.<br/><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li> Use Payscale and the like, but don't put very much stock in them.</li><li> I've found GlassDoor.com to be pretty good. At least, it's quite accurate for software-engineering salaries in the US. I don't know how well it handles Wall Street bonuses that represent much of the income of bankers and hedge-fund managers.</li><li> Search for job ads and see what kinds of salaries and bonuses are offered.</li><li> Get books targeted toward working in that career. For example, Vault has a series (and my college career-services department used to pay for student access to all of them for free). There are lots of other good one-off books about how to get into law, finance, software, etc. and what it's like to work there. Often these will have salary surveys or at least will quote a few offhand numbers about what you can expect.</li><li> Write to people who work in these industries and ask them for ballpark figures. This is easiest if you're in college and have access to an alumni database, but until then, you can ask around among friends, including the 80K Hours folks. Often, just one or two salary point-estimates by someone who you know is at about the same ability level as yourself is better than all the data points in the world from a collection where you don't know who exactly is in the average. (It sounds like you've been asking around a lot already, which is great.)</li></ol>It's great if you can get a few point estimates of pay at different levels of experience, so that you can do your own line-fitting of "income vs. years worked." I used to have an Excel spreadsheet where I would do present-value computations for various starting salaries, salary-growth-rate assumptions, and discount rates. Tables <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dwsimpson.com/salary.html">like these for actuaries</a> are really great if you can find them, but it's rare to get such clean data.<br/><br/>As far as education suggestions, here's one idea. Unless you want to do medical school or you're 100% certain you don't want to make money but instead want to go into cognitive-science research, you could study computer science and/or statistics, with some business/finance and maybe a few math/physics/engineering courses thrown in. (Okay, maybe I'm biased because that's what I did, but I didn't do it for no reason. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/>) This will keep your options open for pretty much anything: software and quantitative finance obviously, but also regular finance, consulting, business, law (which doesn't require specific undergrad preparation), and essentially anything else. I've heard several business/finance recruiters say they'll always take someone with a math-oriented background, because those people are clear thinkers and can do anything. A lot of it is just for <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics)">signaling</a>, but that's how the system works.<br/><br/>Make sure to reserve time to study more about the options, attend college career fairs/visits, do industry internships, talk with upper-level classmates and recent graduates about their plans, etc.<br/><br/>If you don't like statistics/CS/math, there might be other options. In general, most of the hard sciences have the property of being a "master key" for careers, although I think it's more true the more quantitative the field is. Also keep in mind that some computer-science jobs can be pretty <span style="font-style: italic">non</span>-quantitative as far as using math specifically, although I think CS uses similar brain regions as math overall.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>I got in touch (do people who arn't Irish use this saying?<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Yes. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/><br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>and then after that it seems likely to have a shot at academia one needs to get a good degree, probably a first??

Many times employers just hire people who did a college internship, rather than looking for fresh graduates who didn't work for them before.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="5">I'm going to stir the boat for fun.<br/>I can think of one job that is high profile. They have a massive media profile often on TV, often directly stating their message to the youth and all generations. If you took this career path you could espouse utilitarianism through your job. They have the potential to make scad loads of money, which they also often donate. They have fun doing their job. People take a great amount of pleasure from their job. In fact often thousands gather at one place just to watch and listen to them doing their job because it is fun. I can think of two of them that have worked to raise millions to help people in Africa, third world debt relief, increased aid contribution by first world countires, AIDs education amongst some of their better known causes. Think about it, you can be a public face of promoting utilitarianism and reducing suffering! Academia rarely shapes the public debate, lawyers unless they become politicians aren't on TV, and neither of these speak directly to young people. Neither of them have jobs that make the broader public happy to see them... <br/><br/>PS: Just for smiles</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="5">Haha!<br/><br/>Redcarded, I'm not sure how we're defining risk, but the statistician in me wants our readers to know that becoming a rockstar is not just risky in the sense of a great degree of volatility between potential outcomes, but also that the chance of success is extremely slim. And it's the latter that seems to me to be the deciding factor. Utilitarians do not try to become rockstars because although the impact of rockstars is 1000x the impact of non-rockstars, the chance of becoming one is 1/10,000, or something along those lines. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="8">It is a thought I've been tying with recently - advising people to go into celebrity-dominated careers is rarely or never going to be a good idea, but one can imagine that a few people would have gone into them irrationally and got lucky, and now be amenable to utilitarian (or at least GWWCesque) ideas. So perhaps there's some mileage in seeking out the more altruistic megastars to try and win them over as a high risk, high payoff activity. I don't pay much attention to current affairs, so I don't know who'd be on the list, but eg I remember Toby Maguire discussing such things, and Matt Damon and George Clooney are fairly active without seeming too irrational about it.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="8"><blockquote><div><cite>WeAreNow wrote:</cite>Has anyone considered working in the food industry? Reaching a position in a business like McDonald's that gives you sway over a lot of farming practice choices?</div></blockquote><br/>Interesting suggestion!<br/><br/>Purely from the perspective of trying to change McDonald's, I think it would be better to work as an activist from the outside, because<br/><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li> You could spend your full time on it, instead of a small fraction of a busy job.</li><li> You wouldn't have to spend decades rising in the corporate hierarchy before reaching a level where you have that kind of influence.</li><li> Even if you became a McDonald's executive, you would only have a small fraction of the power to decide what the company does. Even the CEO has to answer to the Board and shareholders, and without a business justification, they might not let you get away with it.</li><li> A "business justification" basically has to come from activists who threaten to hurt the PR and customer base of McDonald's if it doesn't give in, and who can give positive publicity if it makes reforms. This reminds me of a quote (perhaps apocryphal, perhaps genuine) <a class="postlink" href="http://www.politicalcortex.com/story/2008/11/8/02944/6322">from FDR when he got elected</a>: "FDR told activists in his own party, 'I agree with you, I want to do it, now make me do it.'"</li></ol>Point #2 in that list is probably the strongest counter-argument.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">However</span>, if we consider not just trying to change the policies of McDonald's but the global picture of what you can accomplish in your life, then aiming to become a McDonald's exec might not be a bad route, because even if you don't push any reforms, you still make a lot of money that you can donate (perhaps surreptitiously, lest your peers find out where it's going!). Of course, if you work for McDonald's, you do have to worry about the extent to which you are more productive than your counterfactual replacement, especially if your job is to increase sales or something.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>BTW, I don't think it's unreasonable to suggest that just a few activists could play a pivotal role in whether or not a push for McDonald's reform succeeds. For example, Henry Spira was the <span style="font-style: italic">sine qua non</span> in several of his campaigns. And in modern times, people like <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pmflegal.com/blog/index.html/2012/04/16/pink-slime-controversy-stokes-clash-over-agriculture">Paul Shapiro</a> still do some pretty amazing things singlehandedly. Yes, we have to factor in replaceability here as well, but some people are really exceptional at this work.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="8"><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>Can anyone think of anything relevant/objections to being a advisor to a charities or charities on their movement building and fundraising strategy?</div></blockquote><br/>It sounds like an interesting idea!<br/><br/>In the past, some of us have talked about <span style="font-style: italic">donor consulting</span> (i.e., advising rich people on where to give their money); this is something that's done by consulting firms, investment banks, and other advisory agencies. However, we haven't much thought about the opposite side of things: Consulting for the charities themselves.<br/><br/>It's well known that consulting firms like McKinsey give advice to charities. However, this is presumably more conventional wisdom, and it would not involve some of the more unusual ideas that are common in our parlance.<br/><br/>In order to get a job consulting for charities, you'd probably need background in the basics of mainstream advice-giving. For example, it might help to work for consulting firms, businesses, or nonprofits for a few years in order to build foundational knowledge and establish credibility. With time, you could seek to slip in some more unconventional ideas into your advice.<br/><br/>That said, consulting isn't the only way to change the priorities of a charity. Donors can have an impact also. For example, this year I persuaded Vegan Outreach to use my donation on veg ads instead of regular paper leaflets. That said, donors can have limited ability to figure out optimal suggestions if they're not as embedded in the day-to-day world of the charity's operations as an employee would be.<br/><br/>Therefore, another way to change a charity is from the inside. In recent years, HSUS has worked more and more on high-impact farm-animal issues compared with pets, and this was partly because of the influence of some employees who helped to realign priorities. HSUS has a <a class="postlink" href="http://countinganimals.com/meat-industry-advertising/">$126 million annual budget</a>, so even tiny changes in direction have huge impacts.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I guess charities might be worried about making studies public that aren't fully peer reviewed or that could be taken out of context or something like that (?), but I think it would be salutary to change the incentive structure to encourage sharing. GiveWell has often lamented this same fact: So few charities share their internal data publicly that evaluation is really hard, not to mention that charities have to reinvent and reevaluate their own wheels.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="8">The courses you choose will depend somewhat on your future plans. For example, if you want to make a lot of money, you would probably take less sociology/psychology/philosophy and more finance/statistics/computer science.

If you're unsure, I think it's safer to start with the math/computer science and switch as time goes on, because doing the reverse is harder.<br/><br/>When I took Intro Accounting in college, my advisor asked me why, and I said the reason was that "It's more boring than other courses.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="8">As far as a career advising charities, I'm not totally sure what path to pursue. The best thing is to find people already doing what you want to do and then trace backwards on how they got there. It may be that some of the most well known charity advisers started out in consulting or finance, so that stuff still might not be useless. But probably most of them started out just working for charities directly, and I would guess you'd have to do the same before you gained credibility. (It seems unlikely a charity is going to take advice from someone with no work experience -- except maybe small, close-knit ones like GWWC or 80K Hours or a potential wild-animal-suffering charity.)<br/><br/>In that case, you might ask people at charities where you might want to work what they studied. But my guess is that your major doesn't matter too much for many charity jobs; probably hands-on work experience is more valued? Definitely double-check on this, since I'm not an expert.<br/><br/>You can similarly try to trace back the paths of people who have fundraising careers that you're interested in. What did they study? What kinds of internships did they do? There seem to be several Master's programs in fundraising and grantmaking (e.g., at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.scps.nyu.edu/academics/departments/heyman-center/academic-offerings/ms-in-fundraising-and-grantmaking/curriculum.html">NYU</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://ce.columbia.edu/Fundraising-Management/Course-Descriptions">Columbia</a>, etc.), and these might provide insight into the kinds of topics that professionals run into.<br/><br/>That said, I have no idea if you should actually aim to go to one of these programs or if it would be an unnecessary use of time and money when you could just do applied work directly. My suspicion is that these formal programs might be more useful when fundraising for big, well established causes that have large donors. In the case of animal charities and especially wild-animal charities, the donor base is small, and we probably won't be getting bequeathments from multimillionaires any time soon. (sigh)<br/><br/>If you know charities where you might want to work or for which you might want to fundraise/consult, then you could ask people who work there all of these questions. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/> It might be neat if you could do an externship with them and get a sense of how you like the work on a day-to-day basis.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>I've been wondering if some antispeciesist charities only employ vegans or something though, that would make it harder to recruit fundraisers, maybe people would freak out about something like that though?<br/></div></blockquote><br/>I doubt they would have such requirements. Maybe some extreme animal groups do, but those probably aren't the kinds of places for which you'd be fundraising anyway.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>EDIT: that LIFO joke is so sad D:</div></blockquote><br/>I don't think so. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/> I think it's just amusing.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="8"><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>I have a fairly dim view of sociology<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Yeah, I know what you mean. I guess it depends a lot on exactly what type of sociology it is. Some, as you say, is just a guy's random opinion about the construction of hegemonical social relations in a capitalist society written using deliberately obscure language. But other parts can be good, especially when it's based either on quantitative psychology studies, demographic trends, or even just no-nonsense qualitative narratives of people's lives.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>I would think some kind of mathematical approach would be much more valuable</div></blockquote><br/>Yeah, but you don't need a whole lot of math to succeed -- just 1-3 stats courses should be enough unless you're going to work in the field later on. (Dumb joke: Is this what's meant by "<a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufficient_statistic">sufficient statistics</a>"?)<br/><br/>It's important not to get lost in numbers alone. Sometimes a few real-life anecdotes are worth a thousand statistics.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Most of college is not directly useful later in life, even for people who do the most applied majors. (By saying "directly useful," I'm excluding signaling and general edification. Also networking and making friends.)<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>maybe probably definitely not for me...<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Ha.

Nothing beats direct studies of marketing itself. And then I suspect there's a fair amount of marketing that focuses on running campaigns, using social media, web design, etc. that wouldn't be covered in psychology.

Both offer high expected career earnings, very low risk of no earnings (not important from a strict util perspective, but likely to matter to you), and a fair bit of flexibility in what you can use them for - including non-prophil paths (eg you could go into research after either in numerous fields). Engineering is probably more flexible, medicine probably higher expected earnings in the standard careers (and even higher job security).<br/><br/>Psychology, marketing, business and so on are all relatively soft skills where you'll need to stand out significantly more in order to get your pick of jobs.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="6">I agree with Arepo that engineering and medicine (and law) offer the most reliable stream of income with the lowest chance of unemployment. This, as Arepo says, is because they specifically tailor their students to perform a job. Things like psychology and a general commerce degree are relatively non-specific for seeking employment, especially if one has excluded the possibility of becoming a clinical psychologist. Marketing is possibly an intermediate option. In fact, if you are looking to go down the professional philanthropist pathway, I would ask:<br/>1. Would you want to study Law?<br/>2. Would you want to do software engineering and then start up an online business of some sort?<br/><br/>A couple more questions:<br/>3. Would you want to research the ethics of career choice? Or research the best course to study?

Do you want to influence people by becoming an academic, by joining or starting an organisation like GWWC, or neither?<br/>6. If your goal is to promote important philanthropic ideas, do you think you will be more effective by a) donating money for marketing or b) soliciting money and performing marketing<br/><br/>I'm not sure these have very clear answer but I think these are the correct questions to ask, and I'm sure I and others will also have something to say about them.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="6">Ruairi, I suspect our credence in what we'll be like in future is affected by status quo bias, so I would suggest upgrading the credence you have in the possibility that your preferences (including utilitarianism-guided intentions) might change either because you discover (non-/)aptitude for a subject or simply because you get new information. <br/><br/>That's not to say you should completely revise your plans, it's just an argument in favour of doing something more versatile, all things being equal. I don't actually know what 'versatile' means in this context, so this isn't very concrete advice (my first instinct on seeing Ryan's post was that psychology, being further up the conceptual ladder than marketing, would be more versatile, but given that everyone and their dog needs marketing, maybe that's the opposite of true), just a thought thrown out there.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="6">Thanks Ryan!<br/><br/>BESS is cool and also has good signaling value (within Ireland anyway), well actually any course at Trinity or UCD will probably have good signaling value within Ireland.<br/><br/>The more I think about these things the more I think that perhaps psychology in UCD might be excellent. In my first year I get to do two other arts subjects (maybe economics and sociology?) but also a few "elective" modules, of which there seems to be plenty in marketing. In my second and third years I'd do just psychology but could also take electives in marketing.<br/><br/>Also this course is 3 years rather than 4, I'm not sure if this is better or worse but I think probably better as I can start doing good stuff sooner. What do ye think?<br/><br/>Thanks Arepo, I think you're probably right about status quo bias, I'll keep that in mind.<br/><br/>Thanks so much guys!:D!</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="6">Agree with everything Ruairi said.<br/><br/>How mainstream are you aiming for? If you'd write for more mainstream publications, you'd have lower odds and would have to blunt some of your messages, but you'd reach a big audience and would be taken seriously. If you'd write for less mainstream publications or, say, would become a professional blogger, you'd be able to say more valuable things that can't be put forward in mainstream circles, but you'd have lower reach and also lower income.<br/><br/>In the past, I actually toyed with a career as a high-impact blogger/writer, but I decided the main limiting factor would be income. It would be hard to make money with blogging, so I decided I should instead earn money more efficiently in a conventional lucrative career for a few years, so that I could potentially retire early and do all the writing I want without constraints. If you can get funding from another organization (like 80,000 Hours or EAA, as Ruairi mentioned), you wouldn't have to earn your own money first.<br/><br/>I think there's a lot of low-hanging fruit in popularizing things that aren't well known -- e.g., studies of animal welfare and sentience, ecology applied research to wild-animal suffering, scenarios for future computational suffering, etc. You can reach a much bigger audience with popular articles and blogs than by doing original research and publishing toned-down material in scientific journals, although there is a place for the latter as well.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="6">That's great, Peter!<br/><br/>Sometimes grad students go to the media or popular blogs with their findings. It's plausible to me that the 10% of their time spent on public outreach has at least as much impact as the remaining 90% of their time. (Of course, the remaining 90% gives them something to do outreach about, as well as credibility.)<br/><br/>This might be less true for science or technology where the main goal is to build the knowledge of experts and advance innovation.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="6">Maybe it could be worthwhile to, in another thread, compile a list of research that we think deserves to be brought to a wider audience, and then see where we go from there?

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="6">Hi WAN,<br/><br/>I just got introduced to this site, and I'm actually volunteering right now for an organisation that tries to help people with exactly this problem. (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.80000hours.org">www.80000hours.org</a>) It's related to Giving What We Can, which Brian mentioned.<br/><br/>It's a tough problem, and it's in practice going to depend quite a lot on your strengths, but there are a few general principles. Like people have been mentioning, don't underestimate the value of earning and donating money. Your focus on the developing world is also probably good - the gains to be had there are just so much cheaper than equivalent gains in happiness in the rich world. It's also worth thinking about the extent to which your work is replaceable. So, for example, when you choose to apply for a job as a doctor you don't create a whole new doctor - someone else would have taken your job if you didn't apply. It turns out that you *do* increase the number of doctors (we have to use some economics to analyse how) but your impact won't be as big as it directly seems. We've got loads of blog posts on those and related topics. You should check us out.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
