<h3><a href="#p7281">Panexperientialism</a></h3>
<p class="author"><img alt="Post" height="9" src="../styles/nexus/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" title="Post" width="11"/>by <strong><a href="../user/1169.html">Elijah</a></strong> on 2013-01-08T23:17:00</p>
<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Here's the working draft of a paper of mine on panexperientialism. Tell me what you guys think!   <img alt=":mrgreen:" src="../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif"/> Don't expect too much; I'm just a high-school student.<br/><br/>This paper is not an argument for panexperientialism. Rather, it is an extrapolation from panexperientialism: if panexperientialism is true, the qualia felt by basic cognitive or noncognitive systems (see Rosenberg, 2004 for this terminology) in states functionally similar to human pain are (assuming equal quantity) morally isomorphic to human pain.<br/><br/>1. What is the basic functional definition of pain?<br/><br/>We shall limit ourselves to pain, the most morally important of qualia categories (Pearce, 1995, 2005). The most obvious functional definition of pain is a state A that a system S tries to avoid, and, assuming it has the capacity to do so, S tries to alter A once it has instantiated it. There are states, though, that one tries to avoid but are not really painful; for example, if one is confused while reading a difficult novel. We may add the criterion of urgency or centrality (of avoiding or altering A), but this is insufficient; one may be entirely focused on removing one’s confusion while reading the book above, yet such a state is still not painful. We might add a criterion, therefore, of danger, viz. that pain must represent a state or stimulus that is dangerous to the system (Lycan, 2008 summarizes similar views). But we may employ a Kripkean argument against this criterion, that it is conceivable that one might suffer pain in its full functional sense without any representation involved, e.g., if one is a soul being tormented in Hell. A better criterion would be one along some more general representationalist lines (cf. Lycan, 2008).<br/><br/><br/>2. Are the functional aspects of pain relevant to the ethics thereof?<br/><br/>The notion of qualia that are inherently bad or inherently painful is simply untenable (Lycan, 2008 gives the example of morphine; cf. also Robinson, 2011). Pain-qualia per se are not ethically undesirable; what is undesirable are the pain-qualia plus the functional aspects of pain above. To use Lycan’s (2008) morphine example, morphine does not significantly alter pain-qualia, but it does significantly alter the functional properties associated with pain-qualia. The notion that pain-qualia per se, sans functional properties, are undesirable is incorrect. Along similar lines, any qualia that accompany the functional aspects of pain can be considered pain-qualia. If we assume that the functional aspect of pain must be accompanied by qualia in order to be morally relevant (Pearce, personal communication), there are no grounds for choosing one quale over another to fulfill this function. Some panexperientialist views, however, claim that the “experience” found in noncognitive systems are only analogous to experience, or below the level of experience, or (in some possible worlds) may not be experiential at all (Chalmers, 1996; Rosenberg, 2004). Even so, I suspect that the term “quale” can be simply defined as any intrinsic property, rendering “protoexperiential” properties or non-qualia intrinsic properties nonsense by definition.<br/><br/><br/>3. Objections<br/><br/>There are several major objections to the notion that the qualia of noncognitive systems have moral weight––or, to paraphrase Bentham, that quality of pain being equal plow is as important as plowman. (Cf. Pearce, undated, 2012 for such a position regarding animals.) One is simply to state that an impracticable morality, as is any morality wherein we are morally obligated to avoid causing pain to noncognitive systems, is untenable (cf. Levin, 1997 for this argument against animal rights). This leads us into Dudley/Stephens and Carneadean thought experiments that are too complex to enter into here.<br/><br/>Perhaps qualia are only bound in cognitive systems, and in noncognitive systems they are disunified (Pearce, personal communication). But one must also argue that qualia have no ethical weight unless they are “linked” or “bound” to other qualia. In the case of pain-qualia, perhaps they lack importance unless they are linked to qualia of fear, shame, the feeling of physical resistance, screaming, etc. But Rachels (2012) gives a good argument against such views, noting that pain per se (including, of course, functional elements) can be terrible even without any other qualia involved. What is more, Rosenberg (1997, 2004) has presented a model wherein qualia in noncognitive systems are bound. (I have not finished Rosenberg [2004], so perhaps I ought not to cite his views.) This model is quite elegant, proposing that the binds connecting qualia are the “fire in the equations” between those connections between objects that allow them to causally affect one another, analogous to most panexperientialist models, wherein qualia are the “fire” corresponding to information or function (Chalmers, 1996, cited in Rosenberg, 2004). Note also that Gregg (undated) says that situations analogous to the binding problem can be found in the quantum phenomena of entanglement and BECs. (I am not qualified enough to judge whether this is true for BECs.)<br/><br/>We might also deny that isomorphic ethical arguments necessarily have similar conclusions. This principle, that when ethical arguments are isomorphic they necessarily result in identical conclusions, is commonly used both in metaethics (see Mackie, 1979 for a discussion of such views) and practical ethics (e.g., the trolley problem). But I think we can avoid it. One way is to adopt a sort of holism wherein ethical arguments are more than the sum of their parts (or premises). This, however, seems to leave us with intuitionism (MacIntyre, 19?, gives a good discussion of the problems of intuitionism, cf. also Mackie, 1979). Another is to note that an ethical nihilist who continues using moral terms does not, of course, claim that objective values exist when he uses said terms. What then does he mean? He may be using these terms in an emotivist sense, or he may be using them to mean “I wish that…” (e.g., “Murder is wrong” = “I wish that murder was eliminated or reduced”).1 One’s desires are not produced by rigorous reasoning, so a metaethical nihilist could have different desires or emotions accompanying isomorphic scenarios.<br/><br/><br/>1I believe there is a quote from Russell to the effect that even if metaethical realism is false, he (Russell) still wishes that certain states of affairs will take place over others, and will be willing to act toward these.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">I think that pan-experientialism is probably true and that it's only real competition is metaphysical idealism or solipsism which is still unlikely but can't be dismissed on empirical grounds (as reductive materialism can be) and isn't fundamentally inconceivable because it violates causal laws (as emergent and substance forms of dualism are and do, besides the causal-interaction issues of substance dualism, a mind without an at least illusory body would have no sensory perception and couldn't move through space, being a mind without a body would be like being paralyzed, deaf and blind). I'd be interested in reading what other people think the normative or meta-ethical implications of pan-experientialism or any other mind-body stance are.<br/><br/>My optimism might be unwarranted but I think elementary particles are more likely to experience happiness than pain because they don't have the homeostasis requirements that animals and other motile biological organisms do (I don't think that trees, rocks or other things that don't appear to behave with agency have a unified experience of being those things, they're probably just comprised of elementary particles that are physically bonded but don't feel and act in unity the way the particles we're comprised of do). I'd think that their desires are more simple, they probably lack the complicated cognitive psychology that leads to a lot of suffering in humans and I'd even hope that they can feel love since they seem to be driven by a need to bond with other particles. <br/><br/>I just received a few books in the mail on pan-experientialism  that I can't wait to to read.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>How do you know that these quarks are better off destroyed?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I doubt that they can be destroyed. If pan-experientialism is true, phenomenonal consciousness is as old as time itself and will probably always exist in one form or another.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
