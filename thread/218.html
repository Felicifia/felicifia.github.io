<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Hi, SJM. I can't recall whether "rights" is a term that Peter uses or avoids. Anyway, I'll describe his position as I remember it:<br/><br/>non-persons should be treated in accordance with their desires. Non persons are defined, if I recall correctly, as those who do not plan their futures, so most of their desires will be rooted in the here and now. e.g. "I do not want pain", "I do not want to die", "I want to be around my family". <br/><br/>If we want to exploit a non-person for food, for example, we need to weigh their preferences against our own. e.g. do this animal's wish to be healthy, spend time with its family and so on outweigh my preference for a slightly tastier meal?<br/><br/>In the cases of persons, Peter Singer suggests there may be other considerations. For example, killing a person might thwart their plans to take a particular career path. It will send a wave of greif farther through person-to-person social networks.<br/><br/>Peter doesn't believe in 'inalienable rights', or rights that should never be broken. He believes that treating persons and non-persons in accordance with their desires is part of treating others as we would be treated.<br/><br/>I hope that's a good start SJM <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/><br/><br/>edit: fixed the thinko (a 'typo' that did not result from a slip of the fingers') identified by DanielLC</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

From what I understand you need sophisticated existential desires to be granted a right to life. Something only persons have.  <br/><br/><br/>#Though I would note that I can across one reference that children only fully understand the concepts of life and death  on average in the 9-11th years so we can have persons that pass the self awareness mirror test at 18+ mnths that technically still don't have existential desires <br/><br/><br/>I think I fully comprehend that. I also note that Peter's argument means that non person animals don't have a right to life.<br/>My real difficulty is when he justifies existential normative results to 'normal' non person humans. In teh context we aren't supposed to be speciest.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

It is just a brute desire firmly place in the present and tied to pain. So nothing controversial.<br/><br/>The trouble is neonates aren't persons and while I know his famous thought experiment with severely disabled orphans wasn't meant to say we should do this- it was meant to argue against speciesism- nor does it strictly say we shouldn't.<br/><br/>Now from what I understand Peter then goes onto use Preference Utilitarianism to say we cannot kill non person babies and infants because it would in affect/frustrate the parents preferences. But we do in fact have parents killing their kids so one could argue that by stopping them from killing their kid we are frustrating their preference. I know you will then say other people within the social network would then be affected. But since we ignore this for people that object to animals being killed for whatever reason or in fact Pro-Life conservatives it would seem to require us to ignore other social network concerns as well.<br/><br/>Another problem would be if we had in fact a growing movment who thought infanticide of non person humans was the next step, consistent with the current personhood arguments, or in fact had a whole society like the ancient Greeks or Romans that viewed infanticide as acceptable, I don't see how Peter would object.  The infants don't have existential desires and the social network has no preferences being frustrated, so logically this should be ok when combining personhood based arguments with Preference Utilitarianism.<br/><br/>This could be tied in to problems and weighting of aggregation similar to the general slavery objection to Utilitarianism but this objection is even harder as no person is directy having their preferences frustrated.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
