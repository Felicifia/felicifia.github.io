<h3><a href="#p7789">Re: Negative-leaning utilitarianism as classical utilitarianism</a></h3>
<p class="author"><img alt="Post" height="9" src="../styles/nexus/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" title="Post" width="11"/>by <strong><a href="../user/185.html">Pablo Stafforini</a></strong> on 2013-02-25T13:36:00</p>
<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Here's a reason to be skeptical about the intuition that motivates your "non-classical" exchange rate between positive and negative experiences.  <a class="postlink" href="../thread/625.html#p5561">Elsewhere</a> you write that you have "toyed with non-pinprick negative utilitarianism when the experience is as bad as, say, 2 minutes of burning at the stake." But you acknowledge that there are decisive objections against negative utilitarianism.  So you embrace instead a form of "semi-negative" utilitarianism where intense pains are weighed more heavily in the calculus than are on classical utilitarianism.  The mental process by which you arrive at your current position thus seems to me something like this:<br/><br/>1. "It seems intuitively that, for pains of sufficient intensity, there is no amount of pleasure that could outweigh them."<br/>2. "So I should become a negative utilitarian."<br/>3. "But wait!  When I try to express this intuition formally, I can see that the resulting theory is unsustainable."<br/>4. "Okay, then I should embrace <span style="font-style: italic">semi</span>-negative utilitarianism instead: a form of utilitarianism that attaches much more--but finite--weight to pains relative to pleasures.  Such a theory approximates my original intuition tolerably well, without facing the problems of strict negative utilitarianism."<br/><br/>Now, if it turns out that the theory that best represents the intuition can be shown to face decisive objections, doesn't this provide reasons to be skeptical about the intuition that motivated that theory?  When modern physics tells me that my naive theory about the world is wrong, I don't react to this by coming up with a new, unobjectionable theory that tries to preserve the intuition that made me believe the original theory.  Instead, I react by concluding that my physical intuition was unreliable, and shouldn't be trusted.<br/><br/>Moreover, we do have some plausible "debunking" psychological mechanisms accounting for why it seems to you (and many others, <span style="font-style: italic">including</span> many classical utilitarians like myself) that intense pleasures are so serious, relative to pleasures.  Carl Shulman, for instance, has speculated that, due to evolutionary pressures, we should expect creatures like us to be capable of experiencing much more intense pains than pleasures.  We could add that, because this difference in intensity is so great, it might appear to be infinite, or "incommensurable", due to our inability to intuitively process large numbers (cf. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.stafforini.com/quotes/?p=647">Broome</a>).<br/><br/>Thus, we have <span style="font-style: italic">independent</span> reasons to distrust the intuitions that, if taken literally, would result in a theory that can shown to be false.  On the whole, then, I think it's far more reasonable to conclude that the intuition that motivates semi-negative utilitarianism is unreliable, and that as such shouldn't be accorded evidential weight in our moral theorizing, than to try to preserve the spirit of the intuition by tweaking the theory until it no longer faces the original objections.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote><div><cite>Brian wrote:</cite>No, Virginia, there really is no such thing as a utilon in any non-arbitrary sense</div></blockquote><br/><br/>This seems to me a very weird claim, at least in the very strong sense (â€˜anyâ€™) in which youâ€™ve phrased it here. Sure, there might not be any identifiable Planck-esque unit of welfare, but you seem to be saying that if I consented, with full information, to a sufferingâ€“pleasure trade that only impacted my own welfare, you might overrule it, not on the grounds that you think Iâ€™ve made a factual error, but because you just think your <span style="font-style: italic">caring</span> trumps mine. This seems intuitively bizarre.<br/><br/>It also seems recursive. Do you calibrate your intuitions, for eg? If so, what are you calibrating them against? If thereâ€™s some standard, some sense in which your intuitions can be improved, then there must be some sense in which theyâ€™re non-arbitrary (in which case we can posit a non-arbitrary utilon even if the unit itself is only a measurement of convenience, like those of the metric system, for eg). If thereâ€™s no sense in which they can be improved, why bother informing them at all? <br/><br/>How can it be wrong to go with your gut reaction to any ethical question, if your gut reaction is the only ethically relevant factor in the question?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">I'll now address a different aspect of Brian's defense of semi-negative utilitarianism.  He writes:<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Of course, we can choose to make our assignments more uniform. We can say that very "similar" experiences (e.g., stubbing my big toe vs. stubbing my little toe) shouldn't have vastly different numbers attached. We can try to impose other regularity conditions that seem plausible and jive with our intuitions. But at the end of the day, it's up to us what numbers we pick.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I'm not sure that this is the case.  As I wrote <a class="postlink" href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/utilitarianism/permalink/316000371837147/?comment_id=316009121836272&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=11">in a Facebook comment</a> a while ago:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>[I believe] we can make comparisons between levels of suffering and happiness independently of our values. When I introspect, I find that I can say things like "the suffering I experienced this morning was at least two times more intense than the happiness I experienced this afternoon" without making any assumptions about the relative value of these experiences. But [...] semi-negative utilitarians [need not] agree that these comparisons are possible. [...] One way the semi-negative utilitarian could formulate his or her position is by saying that a pain of a given intensity instantiates more negative value than a pleasure of that same intensity instantiates positive value (I believe Jamie Mayerfeld formulates his view in this way). But there is an alternative formulation: the semi-negative utilitarian could simply say that more pleasure is needed to fully cancel the negative value of a given pain than a classical utilitarian would require. The first formulation assumes that there is an "objective phenomenal exchange rate" between pleasure and pain, but the second formulation makes no such assumption.</div></blockquote><br/>In case the paragraph above is not sufficiently clear, let me try to make the same point in a different way.  Consider this claim:<br/><br/>(1) Positive and negative experiences are "polar opposites" of each other, in the sense that every positive experience has an intensity that is matched by the intensity of a given negative experience.  This is not an arbitrary artifact of the way we choose to measure the respective intensities of positive and negative experiences, but is rooted in the nature of the experiences themselves.  Just as a certain amount of positive charge is needed to cancel the negative charge of a subatomic particle, so similarly there is a certain intensity of positive experience that will "cancel" the intensity of a negative experience.<br/><br/>Brian denies this claim, and argues that semi-negative utilitarianism should not therefore be defined as the view that<br/><br/>(2) negative experiences are more seriously bad than the corresponding positive experiences are good,<br/><br/>because there is no objective matching between positive and negative experiences, but claims that this position should instead be defined as the view that<br/><br/>(3) negative experiences are more seriously bad, relative to positive experiences, than classical utilitarians claim they are.<br/><br/>As defined in (3), semi-negative utilitarianism doesn't presuppose any objective matching between experiences of different a sign value; rather, it defines itself in opposition to the subjective evaluations of other people (specifically, classical utilitarians).<br/><br/>I agree that, if (1) is false, semi-negative utilitarianism, as defined in (3), would not be more arbitrary than classical utilitarianism.  However, if (1) is true and semi-utilitarianism is defined as in (2), then it seems to me that classical utilitarianism has an advantage over semi-negative utilitarianism, since the null hypothesis should be that positive and negative experiences of the same objective intensity are equally valuable, and hence unless an additional, positive reason is provided for deviating from that hypothesis, that is the position we should take.<br/><br/>To sum up the contents of both this and my previous comment, I think there are a number of considerations against semi-negative utilitarianism:<br/><br/>(I) Semi-negative utilitarianism is an attempt to do justice to the spirit of the intuition that originally motivated negative utilitarianism.  Since NU can be decisively shown to be false, we should be skeptical of that intuition.<br/><br/>(II) There is a plausible debunking explanation of why people believe in negative and semi-negative utilitarianism.<br/><br/>(III) Semi-negative utilitarianism is more arbitrary than classical utilitarianism.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

"Okay, then I should embrace <span style="font-style: italic">semi</span>-negative utilitarianism instead: a form of utilitarianism that attaches much more--but finite--weight to pains relative to pleasures.

So my past intuitions have been in multiple places.<br/><br/>I think the reasoning steps 1-4 above are fine, because why would I choose something more counterintuitive than it needs to be? What I tried to suggest in my post was that there isn't a unique classical utilitarianism at all, so you can't argue for classical utilitarianism on Occam grounds. Ok, maybe you could say that assignments of goodness/badness parameter values that use fewer bits to specify are better on Occam grounds, but there has to be a countervailing factor, or else we're going to end up assigning 0 to everything because it takes the fewest bits to specify. In any event, maybe I don't care about Occam here. As the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_My_Party_(song)">song</a> says, "It's my party, and I'll use the numbers I want to."<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Pablo Stafforini wrote:</cite>(3) negative experiences are more seriously bad, relative to positive experiences, than classical utilitarians claim they are.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Yes.

Then you canâ€™t invoke undervaluing my future self (conceptually you can, since I might arbitrarily value further-future-me more than near-future me, but this is hard to believe) as a reason to overrule me. So then, if you think Iâ€™m not actually wrong about anything, you basically have to accept that youâ€™re simply forcing your arbitrary desires on me.

On your worldview, value is set by/defined as what you think it is. So understanding the world canâ€™t possibly improve your intuitions, since theyâ€™re arbitrary anyway and we reject any non-arbitrary criteria against which we could evaluate them. In short what youâ€™re arguing for isnâ€™t really utilitarianism, but an intuitionism that happens to map very closely onto utilitarianism.<br/><br/>But in that case it doesnâ€™t make sense to appeal to the expected value of information, the way utilitarians normally would â€“ your intuitions will still be there, still the source of all value, whether or not you learn what qualia insects actually experience. <br/><br/>So if itâ€™s good to get more insight, it must be a fundamental good, one which we can weigh against the others in your value system, like pain and pleasure. That is, even where your knowledge has no instrumental value, it has some positive value such that it would be worth removing some amount of pleasure/adding some amount of pain to the world for you to understand it better.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

(Pablo earlier this week <a class="postlink" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/utilitarianism/permalink/339959552774562/">shared my own thoughts on negative-leaning utilitarianism</a>.)<br/><br/>I'm fine with Toby's points up through "The worse-for-everyone argument." In that argument, Toby says:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Indeed, suppose that there was a situation in which all individuals want to accept 5 wellbeing units of suffering in order to gain 10 wellbeing units of happiness. This would be in everyone's interest. However, Weak NU would say that it was impermissible<br/></div></blockquote><br/>My response is, no, there is <span style="font-style: italic">no such thing</span> as a wellbeing unit apart from our utilitarian assessment of the situation. There are no utilons except the ones that we project onto what we observe.<br/><br/>Now maybe Toby is thinking of something like von-Neumann-Morgenstern utility derived from preference orderings. But I'm a hedonistic utilitarian, and I don't care intrinsically what people's choices are. People make a lot of choices they later regret. In any event, organisms take many actions that aren't purely hedonically driven. The brain is built from dozens/hundreds of motivational hacks that developed at specific times for specific uses -- like, say, the drive to escape predators even if your life is miserable or the drive to have unprotected sex in the heat of the moment despite later consequences. Animals seem to have a "will to live" independent of hedonic considerations. Post-humans with advanced knowledge of neuroscience could build a mind that would choose to consciously suffer. We don't normally see this because in nature, liking and wanting usually align pretty closely, but in principle, there's no reason a robot couldn't choose to cause itself agonizing conscious experiences.<br/><br/>So it's not the case that everything people choose aligns with a hedonic calculation. And even deciding how much different parts of the hedonic calculation matter requires exchange rates between types of experiences. So I deny these "wellbeing units" of which Toby speaks if they're not just our own degree of caring about the experiences in the first place.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>For example, it implies it is generally good if people get murdered, and there is no reason for police or society to do anything to stop this. Indeed it would typically be immoral for them to stop the murderers. Similarly, it is great news if your mother dies. Furthermore, it also implies that much healthcare and lifesaving is of enormous negative value. It says that the best healthcare system is typically the one that saves as few lives as possible, eliminating all the suffering at once. This turns healthcare policy debates on their heads and means we shouldn't be emulating France or Germany, but should instead look to copy failed states such as North Korea.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>No, in practice, even a full negative utilitarian would not support such things, because societies of this type would probably have more total suffering. In any event, focusing on present-day humans is not a priority. Real negative utilitarians will be focused on wild animals and future sentients, and doing this means getting along in society without making lots of enemies.<br/><br/>In the "Alternatives" section, Toby lists some intuitions that can tempt people toward NU that are actually non-utilitarian intuitions. I do not share any of these intuitions on reflection; they are not the reason I give severe suffering more weight, and they do not appease that intuition. The only paragraph in that section with which I do identify is the last one, which is a utilitarian argument: "adding happiness to those who are already happy seems to typically lead to less Utilitarian value than using the same resources to alleviate suffering."<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>Finally, I want to point out that I don't lean very negative except for extreme suffering. For ordinary pains vs. ordinary pleasures, I probably agree with most people's assessments about the tradeoffs. I suspect that many people in rich countries do have net-worthwhile lives, because most of them are never tortured, eaten alive, drowned, thrown into a <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazen_bull">brazen bull</a>, etc. My negative lean only starts to show itself for these really extreme kinds of suffering, which I think are more serious than people assume.<br/><br/>In theory, torture can be outweighed by enough pleasure, but it's important not to confuse thought experiments with real life. The amount of pleasure needed to outweigh torture is immense, and we almost certainly can't create ratios of pleasure to severe pain that imbalanced in the real world. Even with regard to the future, there's no way we can get the probability of massive torture low enough for our utilitronium-shockwave dreams to compensate in expected value.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Hi Brian,<br/><br/>Thanks for you response!<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Brian Tomasik wrote:</cite>At the end of the discussion, Toby said that I was basically a classical utilitarian, although I approximate weak NU. Thus, most of this essay doesn't apply to my views.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I'm still not quite sure whether you currently believe what I call Weak NU, or what I call Practically-Negative Utilitarianism (if the latter, you seem to be between what I outlined as 'Strong' and 'Weak' versions of it). It would be helpful if you could clarify.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>My response is, no, there is <span style="font-style: italic">no such thing</span> as a wellbeing unit apart from our utilitarian assessment of the situation. There are no utilons except the ones that we project onto what we observe.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>If you are just a Practically-Negative Utilitarian (i.e. a Classical Utilitarian with certain empirical views) then it can make sense to deny the concept of wellbeing. Many Classical Utilitarians make use of wellbeing as a concept, arguing first that happiness and the absence of suffering is what makes an individual's life good for them and then aggregating this. But you might be able to skip this intermediate step if you wanted. However, if you believe Weak NU, then I don't see how you could have a coherent view about how a unit of happiness can count for less than a unit of suffering without some independent yardstick of what these 'units' are, and I don't see any other plausible candidates. If you are a Classical Utilitarian, then you don't believe that a unit of happiness counts less than a unit of suffering.<br/><br/>Even if you deny the concept of wellbeing, there is a question of whether the way you match empirically described levels of suffering with empirically described levels of happiness are morally plausible. For example, if you say a pinprick outweighs a year of happy life I would think this is a crazy view. Even if you say that a day of torture outweighs ten happy years of life, I'd find this pretty implausible too, as I'd certainly make that trade for myself.<br/><br/>It would suggest to me that you are illicitly using your tastes as to how bad things are for people instead of theirs (by tastes I mean how much they would enjoy or suffer from different stimulus, not what they believe before they try it). This would be analogous to me saying that feeding people mushrooms is bad for them (and the world) just because I don't like mushrooms. We should use their scales of how much having a particular thing done to them makes them suffer, not ours. I think you are trying to use their scale for what makes them suffer and how much (e.g. do they find mushrooms great, or unpleasant, or vilely unpleasant), then a universal moral scale (which is in your head given your metaethical views) to rate that. If so, I think you might be making a mistake about the intermediate step. If you really think that the only facts of the matter about how much suffering mushrooms cause me compared to how much happiness love causes me are in Brian Tomasik's head, then I find that a very implausible theory and I think most others will too! <br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>No, in practice, even a full negative utilitarian would not support such things, because societies of this type would probably have more total suffering.<br/></div></blockquote><br/><br/>I really don't think you have dodged this bullet here. Even with those empirical views about the side effects of murder, you would have to believe, for example, that it is *great* that your mother got murdered and that other people get murdered -- it is one of the best things that can happen to them (for their own sake) -- but that it is a real pity it comes with additional side effects which will outweigh this great blessing. This is a really implausible thing! You may not believe it is true in your country, which might make the bullet easier to bite for you, but it sounds like you would have to believe it of most people in the world, which is still pretty shocking.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>In the "Alternatives" section, Toby lists some intuitions that can tempt people toward NU that are actually non-utilitarian intuitions. I do not share any of these intuitions on reflection; they are not the reason I give severe suffering more weight, and they do not appease that intuition.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote><div><cite>TobyOrd wrote:</cite>Even if you say that a day of torture outweighs ten happy years of life, I'd find this pretty implausible too, as I'd certainly make that trade for myself.</div></blockquote><br/>I certainly wouldn't. The question is, are you underestimating how bad one day of torture is, or am I underestimating how good ten happy years of life are, or are our brains really that different from each other that the difference in hedons is actually a real quantitative difference between our phenotypes?<br/><br/>And here is what really scares me about utilitarianism of this sort: The next logical step is to say, if someone believes that they would make this trade-off, they should endorse governments who <span style="font-style: italic">force</span> this trade-off onto others. And then suddenly, you have a complete game-theoretic paradigm shift where it's no longer about personal choice but about men in uniforms wielding tasers and batons kicking down the doors of unarmed civilians "for their own good" - this seems to invite serious risks of authoritarian negative externalities.<br/><br/>(Btw, if you think this is fiction, look at some of the "suicide intervention" footage on youtube. These are serious human rights violations.)<br/><br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I really don't think you have dodged this bullet here. Even with those empirical views about the side effects of murder, you would have to believe, for example, that it is *great* that your mother got murdered and that other people get murdered -- it is one of the best things that can happen to them (for their own sake) -- but that it is a real pity it comes with additional side effects which will outweigh this great blessing. This is a really implausible thing!</div></blockquote><br/>This interpretation shows the insensitivity of superficial utilitarian thinking to the game theory of individual rights and autonomy: The disutility of tolerating and/or expecting murder is not the prevented life-years, it's the erosion of trust in society. What happens to a society where you have to expect that strangers will stab a knife in your gut when you just want to buy groceries? The externalities of this are considerably higher than the bit of prevented happiness or suffering from a shortened life.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>You may not believe it is true in your country, which might make the bullet easier to bite for you, but it sounds like you would have to believe it of most people in the world, which is still pretty shocking.</div></blockquote><br/>I've worked with elderly people who openly wished for death, and weren't allowed to die. When they finally did die from natural causes, we (the staff) all inofficially agreed that it was good they finally died, and there was nothing shocking about it. The question is what exact aspects lead you to the conclusion that it is shocking if a person dies and we judge it to be good rather than bad. This is probably not a purely utilitarian intuition.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Brian wrote:</cite>You make a good point. There may be a big difference between theory and practice. At the end of the day, what I said is honestly the way I see things, but in real life, it may often be better to let people make their own choices. In any event, people are a rounding error compared with animals, and we have to be more paternalistic with regard to animals.</div></blockquote><br/>Yes, inevitably. I also agree there's the risk that people underestimate the suffering of animals or overestimate their happiness. As for the theory vs. practice aspect, you could commit to a simple heuristic never to override people's choices if they seem well-informed and non-whimsical unless the externalities are comparatively huge (and never endorse such overrides). Combined with your heuristic to be honest about your positions, this could avoid a lot of alienation (and prevent interpretation of your position as justifying authoritarian power abuse, which I think causes predictably more harm than good).<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>peterhurford wrote:</cite>Certainly utilitarianism generally, and even preference utilitarianism, does allow some degree of paternalism. And also some degree of "I won't let you drink from this water despite you being really thirsty and wanting it really badly, because I know it contains a deadly poison and you do not.</div></blockquote><br/>Yes, clearly. I would have experienced a lot less personal resentment if paternalists were only trying to overcome epistemic deficits rather than forcing their value judgments into the lives of others.<br/><br/>Let me also reiterate that a lot of my resentment comes from the authentic experience that (fake) paternalism is often just a smokescreen for much less benevolent motivations.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Thanks, Toby! It's nice to have you back for a visit on Felicifia.<br/><br/>By the way, I didn't say so in my first reply, but I appreciate the earnestness of your essay. You're aiming to do what you think is a good thing by encouraging some with NU intuitions to second-guess their position. In turn, I think I'm doing a good thing by defending a certain flavor of negative-leaning utilitarianism (even if its resemblance to NU is more practical than theoretical).<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>TobyOrd wrote:</cite>I'm still not quite sure whether you currently believe what I call Weak NU, or what I call Practically-Negative Utilitarianism (if the latter, you seem to be between what I outlined as 'Strong' and 'Weak' versions of it).<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Yes, it's a subtle issue. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/> I've refined my own thinking over the years about exactly what I mean by my position.<br/><br/>Weak NU is sometimes the way I talk about my position, but it's not exactly right. Speaking of an "exchange rate" on top of suffering and happiness presupposes there is such a thing as amounts of suffering and happiness independent of the exchange rate. But in fact, suffering and happiness have the magnitude that we decide they have. We assign a suffering value to experiences X, Y, and Z; there's not an independent measure of them, which is the point I made when denying "The worse-for-everyone argument."<br/><br/>On the other hand, it's empirically the case that the negative values I assign to extreme suffering are larger than those assigned by most people. So if I do talk about an exchange rate of E, what I actually mean is that, "relative to the human population's average magnitude of suffering for torture, my parameter assignment is E times bigger." (Of course, the average magnitude of suffering due to torture for the population may be infinite due to some negative utilitarians among us, but we could talk about the median instead.)<br/><br/>So I'm a classical utilitarian who believes that torture-level suffering is actually as bad as the numbers I assign to it, but I don't claim that other people will necessarily agree with my assessment of how bad it is. Empirically it seems I care about it more than most people.<br/><br/>You could almost call this "Strong Practically-Negative Utilitarianism," but I don't agree with the description of that in the article: "Classical Utilitarianism with the empirical belief that suffering outweighs happiness in all or most human lives." I think many people in rich countries probably have net positive lives because they don't typically experience torture-level suffering. If a person lived 75 years of a happy life and then died after being conscious for 5 minutes in a brazen bull, I would say that life was net negative. But most wealthy people never experience anything like a brazen bull in their lifetimes (for which we can be grateful).<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>TobyOrd wrote:</cite>If you are a Classical Utilitarian, then you don't believe that a unit of happiness counts less than a unit of suffering.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Yes, this is my position, but with the proviso from above that I realize that my assessments don't map onto the median assessments, and I'm not troubled by this either, because ultimately, all the numerical hedonic assignments in classical utilitarianism are up to us to decide; they're not facts "out there" in the world.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>TobyOrd wrote:</cite>For example, if you say a pinprick outweighs a year of happy life I would think this is a crazy view.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>No, I'm close to the population median in my views of how bad a pinprick is relative to happiness.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>TobyOrd wrote:</cite>Even if you say that a day of torture outweighs ten happy years of life, I'd find this pretty implausible too, as I'd certainly make that trade for myself.<br/></div></blockquote><br/> <img alt=":shock:" src="../images/smilies/icon_eek.gif"/> <br/>A <span style="font-weight: bold">day</span> of torture!?!!!<br/>I wouldn't take even 10 seconds of torture for 10 years of extra happy life.<br/>Maybe we're not being specific enough about what kind of torture. How many minutes in a brazen bull for 10 happy years?<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>TobyOrd wrote:</cite>It would suggest to me that you are illicitly using your tastes as to how bad things are for people instead of theirs (by tastes I mean how much they would enjoy or suffer from different stimulus, not what they believe before they try it).<br/></div></blockquote><br/>A few things to say:<br/><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li> Your statement assumes that people's hedonic welfare is deducible from their choices. As noted in my first reply, I don't trust people's choices to necessarily reflect their hedonic self-interest. There are evolutionary drives pushing people to prefer existence irrespective of its average hedonic value.</li><li> There is no unique person making a choice about whether torture is acceptable. If you torture someone hard enough, he will give in. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/books/1984-3-05.htm">From <span style="font-style: italic">1984</span></a>:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>â€˜By itself,â€™ he said, â€˜pain is not always enough. There are occasions when a human being will stand out against pain, even to the point of death. But for everyone there is something unendurableâ€”something that cannot be contemplated. Courage and cowardice are not involved. If you are falling from a height it is not cowardly to clutch at a rope. If you have come up from deep water it is not cowardly to fill your lungs with air. It is merely an instinct which cannot be destroyed. It is the same with the rats. For you, they are unendurable. They are a form of pressure that you cannot withstand. Even if you wished to. You will do what is required of you.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>In a calm, euthymic state, you might decide to go for the torture in return for the happy years. In the throes of torture, you <span style="font-style: italic">would</span> change your mind and wish you had never made the bargain. Which is the Toby whose preferences we should listen to?</li><li> We can't get away from making some judgment calls based on our own intuitions. Consider the problem of interpersonal comparisons of utility. Say David Pearce would not accept any amount of happy life in exchange for one minute of a brazen bull. Say a year of happy life is +1. Then does that mean that 1 minute of a brazen bull is -infinity for David? Does this swamp all the happiness any finite number of Tobys could ever experience? No -- it means we need some third party (i.e., me) to decide how to compare the experiences of the two people. Now, you could insist that the utilities be normalized in such a way as to respect each person's individual choices, so that you would only need this third-party arbitration among people. But hey, Toby_now and Toby_under_torture are two different people, and Toby_under_torture would say that no amount of happiness could outweigh what he's experiencing now. So even here, we need a third party arbiter to decide. In other words, there's no getting away from the kind of arbitration that I'm doing. People do not have unique, stable preferences about these tradeoffs. (This is seen even in the fact that I change my own third-party-arbiter sentiments depending on my mood.)</li></ol><br/><blockquote><div><cite>TobyOrd wrote:</cite>you would have to believe, for example, that it is *great* that your mother got murdered and that other people get murdered -- it is one of the best things that can happen to them (for their own sake) -- but that it is a real pity it comes with additional side effects which will outweigh this great blessing.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>No, because (1) as noted, many people in rich countries have net positive lives and (2) even if the person's life weren't positive, murder sounds a lot more painful than death in a hospital with pain medicine, and considering that the pain of death is one of the worst things anyone experiences, it's much better to wait a few years for a more humane death.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>TobyOrd wrote:</cite>You may not believe it is true in your country, which might make the bullet easier to bite for you, but it sounds like you would have to believe it of most people in the world, which is still pretty shocking.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>I haven't studied the average quality of life of people in other countries. My guess based on the hedonic treadmill is that their lives aren't too much worse, but it might depend a lot on the details (e.g., more likely that life is net positive for independent farmers than for slave laborers who are beaten, etc.).<br/><br/>In any event, it's clear that your argument about murder is unfair because of the emotions it arouses without justification. For example, you surely must think there are people who would be better off if they didn't exist (e.g., people with severe mental illnessess causing their lives to be absolutely agonizing). I could then argue that you think it would be *great* if those people got murdered, ignoring the side-effects of the murder. This gives an unfair tone to what is otherwise a reasonable position because it's hard to shake off the "side-effects of murder" from the way we're imagining it. Those people getting murdered without the side-effects of murder basically means those people being allowed to euthanize themselves in peace, which is a far different thing to imagine.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>TobyOrd wrote:</cite>That's very interesting.

If David thought more clearly about the situation, he would realize that a day of torture could be outweighed by 10 years of happy life. Well, in this case, Toby has gotten into the business of making judgment calls about people's hedonic balances that go against their own firmly held, seemingly cool-headed beliefs about what they themselves would want. This is what Toby criticized me for doing.<br/><br/>Toby has two choices:<br/><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li> Admit that he's "torturing David Pearce against his will" in the sense that he's supporting policies that will create people like David Pearce who will be tortured without an infinite amount of compensating happiness for themselves or other organisms. (I'm including the "other organisms" caveat because utilitarianism often makes tradeoffs that hurt some in order to benefit others. But my point is that according to David, the amount of benefit to others is not sufficient, in the sense that even if all the benefit went to himself, he would not accept it.)</li><li> Deny that David Pearce's true will is actually to give up arbitrary amounts of happiness to avoid torture, in which case Toby is claiming he knows better than the informed choice of his wise friend.</li></ol>Of course, I'm in the same boat.

Pleasantness and unpleasantness are clearly real and their intensities are clearly encoded somehow. Maybe you are doubting that they can be coherently abstracted as cardinal numbers - maybe because they are too complex patterns, or different modes of experience that don't have "the same unit", if you will. But we use cardinal numbers to express other complex patterns (e.g. GDP, which expresses wealth that is clearly "out there" in the world). And it seems that at least for simultaneous stimulation, activations of certain pains and pleasures can cancel each other partially or fully (measured by the behavoir, including self-assessment).<br/><br/>Let's say you're right and there's nothing "out there" in the world that could be expressed in hedons. But then why bother at all? Why not just say, whatever happens, happens. I could surely act indifferently to whether I enter a Brazen Bull and then if I do, just resolve the situation by screaming a lot. If the intensity encodings aren't "out there", i.e. real things in the brain, why should I care about them cognitively?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1"><blockquote><div><cite>Brian Tomasik wrote:</cite>My response is, no, there is <span style="font-style: italic">no such thing</span> as a wellbeing unit apart from our utilitarian assessment of the situation. There are no utilons except the ones that we project onto what we observe.<br/><br/>Now maybe Toby is thinking of something like von-Neumann-Morgenstern utility derived from preference orderings. But I'm a hedonistic utilitarian, and I don't care intrinsically what people's choices are.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>There's something funny going on here. You think utilons are an arbitrary construction determined by how much we care about the experiences in question. You also think there's nothing fundamentally important about people's preferences, and even that they can be mistaken, as judged by how much welfare they bring the person - so it seems as though the value of a choice would boil down to the welfare(utilons) it brings, and by transitivity, to how much we care about the experiences. <br/><br/>But now we seem to have gone in a circle. What is this 'caring' thing you speak of, if not something resembling a preference or the utilon values of generating possible outcomes, and why might anyone - you included - heed it? The only fundamental difference I can see between it and a regular preference is that on your ethic it refers only to *your* preference.<br/><br/>Obviously (almost by definition) you'll struggle to persuade others to heed such a personal ethic, though I think that probably doesn't matter to you, since you're only considering your marginal decisions?<br/><br/>What seems more odd is that it being your ethic doesn't really seem relevant to any of the objections you yourself raise, and if not it's clearly circular. If it's basically a preference, then just because it's your preference you presumably wouldn't claim that the possibility of it being misguided falls to nil. So does it relate to the amount of utilons the ideas of other people's suffering cause you? Presumably not, since utilons don't exist in your view. So by transitivity it boils down to how much you care about how much you care matters.<br/><br/>I don't think circularity is instant disproof of an epistemological(ish) principle - at some level we have to either assert or self-justify (if there's any difference between the two). But what makes this axiom of Brian's caring (aBc) seem dubious to me is that once you exclude from its recipe either utilons or preference it seems totally incommunicable even in principle. <br/><br/>If someone says to me 'I'm experiencing some hedons right now', I might not be able to recreate their experience well, but I can run some approximate simulation of it in my own head, experiencing, or remembering experiencing hedons. If someone says 'I'd prefer coffee to icecream' I might think both that their taste is repugnant and that this 'preference' thing they're talking about is reducible to something like hedons and anticipation of hedons, but I can still just about parse it well enough to imagine coffee preference. If someone modus ponens to me I can't exactly empathise with it, but I can at least simulate the process it describes in my head an observe that it tends to produce the predicted results.<br/><br/>aBc has no such properties. If Brian Tomasik tells me X is important because he cares about it, I can't simulate hedonic anticipation, or take Y and run any kind of function that I've been informed about to feed out X.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>In a calm, euthymic state, you might decide to go for the torture in return for the happy years. In the throes of torture, you would change your mind and wish you had never made the bargain. Which is the Toby whose preferences we should listen to?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>From a pragmatic perspective, why not the one who's experienced both? It seems like a lot is riding here on you and Toby's guesstimation of the intensity of a feeling neither of you have ever experienced. Also, how much utility difference is there between 1) 10 minutes in a brazen bull with the assumption that either you'll die from this or survive it and be dumped in the uncaring world along with your injuries to fend for yourself, and 2) 10 minutes in a brazen bull when you've been reliably informed by a source you have near complete confidence in that any damage up to and including brain death will be perfectly reversed on your exit, and you'll then be guaranteed 10 years of the happiest life you can imagine?<br/><br/>I get the impression you're envisaging 1, while Toby is thinking about 2 (and perhaps still will continue to do so even after contemplating it), but the difference in these subjective experiences could be huge (cf Camus 'The Myth of Sisyphus', claiming that Sisyphus' fate, which the original authors presumably picked as one of the worst physical outcomes they could imagine, would actually leave him <span style="font-style: italic">happy</span> after proper contemplation).<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Hedonic Treader wrote:</cite>The next logical step is to say, if someone believes that they would make this trade-off, they should endorse governments who force this trade-off onto others. And then suddenly, you have a complete game-theoretic paradigm shift where it's no longer about personal choice but about men in uniforms wielding tasers and batons kicking down the doors of unarmed civilians "for their own good" - this seems to invite serious risks of authoritarian negative externalities.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I think you're ignoring your own logic from further down in this post here; the primary hedonic impact in the real world of stormtroopers kicking down doors and forcing people to what they say isn't the number of hedons that switch values at the scene where the SA actually wirehead/torture you for a day then give you the happiest life possible for 10 years, it's the social impact caused by living in such a society in fear of something you perceive as very bad happening to you (not to mention the long-term economic impact of making everyone very happy for 10 years and ensuring they're tortured first - imagine just the bureaucracy!).<br/><br/>I don't know why you've suddenly decided sane utilitarians can't look at these situations and judge that actually, in practice, they're worth avoiding. Yes, you or I can construct a thought experiment in which I will think the best outcome is for me to hold Peter down and plug him in, but if you flesh it out, you'll see it's so obviously removed from the real world as to be basically irrelevant. I seriously doubt Peter feels threatened by reading this, so why would you feel threatened on his behalf?<br/><br/>In the future, as separateness of people becomes less embedded a concept in society it's conceivable that some form of coercive happiness might become more appealing, but this will be a very different world, in which a) our intuitions from modern society will be ill-adjusted to imagine what this will be like, b) the more separateness of people breaks down, the less it can make sense to be concerned with one person making decisions for another (and the less anxiety society will feel from it) and c) the more separateness of people is replaced by <a class="postlink" href="../thread/802.html">deflationary personal identity</a>, the more evident it will become that present-me is as capable as anyone of unkindly treating future-me.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

It's not perfect because when euthymia returns, it can give a rosy-retrospection gloss over the past suffering, but indeed, this would still be a very good source of data.

I don't know for sure about the details, but even if this were the case, it doesn't negate the larger point. The only reason we're wondering whether Toby would give in after enough torture is because we want to assess how bad torture is relative to other things for organisms as a whole. Even if Toby is not one, there are many organisms that would say they'd give up all the pleasure in the universe to make the pain stop during bad enough torture. There are some like David who maintain such a position even when not tortured. We are thus forced into the position of arbitrating between inconsistent preferences both between people and even between the same person at different times.<br/><br/>So the objection to my position that my suffering-to-happiness weighting violates people's preferences may be true, but <span style="font-style: italic">every</span> suffering-to-happiness weighting violates someone's preferences about his own wellbeing -- indeed, violates most people's preferences when they're being tortured.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I agree that discussing ethics as something irrelevant to motivation is spurious, but your claim seems to entail two parts: a1) nothing about ethics is worth pursuing except (by definition) what motivates us, and b1) there are no non-arbitrary lines to be drawn or even comparisons to make about experience.<br/><br/>So I agree with a1), but think b) is clearly false. As an analogy consider a2) nothing about physics is worth pursuing except (by definition) what motivates us, and b2) there are no non-arbitrary lines to be drawn or even comparisons to make about gravitational effects. a2 might be more controversial than a1, but I think itâ€™s still basically true, while b2 is clearly false. <br/><br/>So far as I can see, your only argument for b1 is the assertion that it follows from a1. Perhaps the analogy will convince you otherwise (or at least make it clearer why I think your apparently parsimonious view invokes more conceptual entities than it seems).<br/><br/>But more fundamentally than trying to change your intuition, what Iâ€™m trying to argue is that your own view entails b) being false, and so is effectively contradictory.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div> the utilons there wouldn't align with my caring.

If itâ€™s not another name for (some set of concepts including and possibly comprising) hedons or preferences, what qualities does it have to show the distinction?<br/><br/>Hereâ€™s some things I understand about your caring:<br/><br/>i) it entails a mental state (yours)<br/>ii) it comes in different intensities (representable as both positive and negative?), such that you can care about two things and be able to prioritise between them based on expected outcomes<br/>iii) it is something which is visible to other people only via its effect on your behaviour<br/><br/>Thatâ€™s about it. Assuming thatâ€™s not a wild misrepresentation of the traits of â€˜you caringâ€™, it seems that b1 above would entail the claim that at least ii) here holds only for you, which goes beyond metaethical scepticism into solipsism.<br/><br/>I think it also implies that wireheading you against your will to falsely believe that no-one was suffering would be as good an outcome <span style="font-style: italic">on your own account</span> as preventing their suffering.

There are plenty of objective facts about "experience." When Alice hits her hand with a hammer, it triggers more nociceptive neural firings than when a feather falls on her finger.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">I have to admit, I'm getting confused about what we're discussing/disagreeing on.<br/><br/>You seem to be discussing what motivates you to act. <br/><br/>I think we agree that 'ethics' in any metaphysical sense is irrelevant to this. So far so good.<br/><br/>You've now identified what motivates you to act as your preferences. I think this is probably false on any definition of 'preference' which doesn't entail 'that which is revealed by your actions' - I'm fairly sure I've seen you admit to akrasia. This feels like a quibble, but I wonder if it's not relevant to our broader disagreement. It seems like what I'm asserting exists might lie in the middle ground between your actual behaviour and the preferences you believe you have.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Brian Tomasik wrote:</cite>I mean there are no external requirements for me to choose -8 instead of -12 for the severity of a bruised arm</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Suppose you'd bruised your arm, and assigned it -8, then when the pain disappeared you assigned it -12 (and imagine that you gave eating an icecream a constant +5 throughout this thought experiment). On bruising your arm again, you reverted to assigning it -8. So during the pain, if I gave you two icecreams, you'd feel happy on balance, but if I offered to trade you a bruised arm for two icecreams when you weren't in pain, you'd turn me down. But then if I just bruised your arm and gave you two icecreams (in a universe where this has no further effects natch), you'd feel better for it.<br/><br/>You would claim that pain-free Brian hasn't made a mistake here, I think?<br/><br/>Too coldy to parse this well at the moment, but I wonder if a source of our disagreement is over whether/how a mind is reducible. You claimed somewhere that you think a brain split into two minds would double in utility value, presumably implying that 'a mind' is a fundamental unit of experience. <br/><br/>This seems totally alien to me - I think of the mind as something like a vast collection of units of experience who've agreed to trick me into thinking they're unitary because doing so has survival benefits On this account, experiences are very unlikely to *ever* be wholly good or bad, only aggregate to one or the other. In which case there's nothing fundamentally different between aggregating all the experiences in one brain and aggregating all the experiences across several brains, except that the former process has evolved to provide more direct feedback, which might be self-reinforcing (believing I'm suffering might in turn make me suffer more).<br/><br/>If I try to simulate discarding my view and taking up yours, inasmuch as I'm able to do so, your view does seem to make more sense - if minds, then it's not obvious why experiences should be, and it becomes harder or even impossible to draw analogies between the composition of one brain and the composition of a set of brains.<br/><br/>Maybe you can try to simulate the reverse? Then if you find your simulation agreeing with me, I think we'll have refined our point of discussion.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Interesting.

They're not allowed to cause permanent damage, but they often don't know in advance how painful an experience is going to be. Since they don't have any brazen bull survivors to compare against, it seems quite plausible to me that they <span style="font-style: italic">are</span> doing as much harm, for much shorter periods, with the mental safeguards I discussed above modifying the mental state that the pain provokes.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1"><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>You've now identified what motivates you to act as your preferences. I think this is probably false on any definition of 'preference' which doesn't entail 'that which is revealed by your actions' - I'm fairly sure I've seen you admit to akrasia.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Yes. My preferences are what I care about, but they're not necessarily what I do.<br/><br/>Very interesting example with the bruised arm and ice cream. I would say that, while Brian when not experiencing the bruising and ice cream is allowed to assign whatever numbers he wants, I would encourage him to assign numbers closer to representing how he feels during the experiences (namely, he prefers that over unconsciousness for those moments). This is intuitive because Brian during the experiences seems to be in a privileged position in the sense that he's experiencing both things rather than neither. On the other hand, usually these tradeoffs don't involve a privileged position: For example, if in a peaceful state you sign yourself up for torture in return for happiness, but then during torture, you wish you hadn't done so, it's not clear which self to trust more, because neither one is experiencing the other emotion <span style="font-style: italic">at the same time</span>.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>If I try to simulate discarding my view and taking up yours, inasmuch as I'm able to do so, your view does seem to make more sense - if minds, then it's not obvious why experiences should be, and it becomes harder or even impossible to draw analogies between the composition of one brain and the composition of a set of brains.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Yeah. Fundamentally, my position says that feelings are not discrete units but are pictures that we paint when we squint at what a brain does. If I held your view that emotions could be associated with micro-level units that add together linearly, then I would see emotional intensities as being basically absolute, because they'd be fixed by how many of those micro units there were.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>I think we'll have refined our point of discussion.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>What a gentleman you are, Arepo.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>I can anecdotally recount that one of the test subjects, who was renowned for his tolerance to pain (or at least to the same pain stimuli as others) described one experience as '10/10'.</div></blockquote><br/>Yikes! Who would ever sign up for that research?  <img alt=":?" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif"/> <br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Elijah wrote:</cite>What about scaphism?</div></blockquote><br/>It's not as bad per minute as brazen bull. Because my aversion increases really steeply with the per-second intensity of the experience, I might prefer a whole sequence of scaphism over a whole sequence of brazen bull. Of course, I'm not signing up for either. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">A case for optimism: Let's say, conservatively, the future will see a technology that allows the safe induction of non-addictive pleasure of at least 10% the intensity of our current worst known agony. Let's say this happens with only 10% probability, but if it happens, it will probably be wide-spread.<br/><br/>Assume that people will use this pleasure-inducing technology as often as they now watch TV, listen to mp3s, or have non-reproductive sex. That's a lot of seconds of pleasure per second of agony, assuming a distribution like on our planet. Even wild animals have far more seconds of sex and play than seconds of intense agony, on average.<br/><br/>Furthermore, agony will be much rarer or go away altogether in scenarios in which even the mildest pain-reducing hedonic augmentation technologies are widely applied. Given the above numbers, you would only need a ratio of 100 seconds of this pleasure to 1 second of agony, which seems entirely reasonable. (This is an argument in addition to the higher expected quantity of hedonium than dolorium)<br/><br/>If you think the probability is too optimistic, or if you value suffering intrinsically more than pleasure, you can use other numbers. But the case may still stand, since 100:1 of "efficient entertainment" seconds per 1 agony second is really very conservative.<br/><br/>If you care about intensity non-linearly, you could consider only the probability of scenarios with artificial pleasures that are <span style="font-style: italic">as</span> intense, or even more intense, than our current agony, and consider their relative distribution.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">I did write a brief response to Toby on Facebook....<br/>___________<br/><br/>Toby, a few thoughts...<br/><br/>1) World destruction? You write, "a thorough going Negative Utilitarian would support the destruction of the world (even by violent means") No, a thoroughgoing _classical_ utilitarian is obliged to convert your matter and energy into pure utilitronium, erasing you, your memories and indeed human civilisation. By contrast, the negative utilitarian believes that all our ethical duties will have been discharged when we have phased out suffering. Thus a negative utilitarian can support creating a posthuman civilisation animated by gradients of intelligent bliss where all your dreams come true. By contrast, the classical utilitarian is obliged to erase such a rich posthuman civilisation with a utilitronium shockwave. In practice, I don't think it's ethically fruitful to contemplate destroying human civilisation, whether by nuclear Doomsday devices or utilitronium shockwaves. Until we understand the bounds of intelligent agency. the ultimate sphere of responsibility of posthuman superintelligence is unknown. Quite possibly, this ultimate sphere of responsibility will entail stewardship of our entire Hubble volume across multiple quasi-classical Everett branches, maybe extending even into what we naively call the past (cf. <a class="postlink" href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0105101v2.pdf">http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0105101v2.pdf</a>). In short, we need to create full-spectrum superintelligence.<br/><br/>2) Negative utilitarians can (and do!) argue for creating immense joy and happiness. Indeed, other things being equal, negative utilitarians are ethically bound to do so, For the thought of a painless but joyless world strikes most people as _depressing_. Negative utilitarians are committed to phasing out even the faintest hint of disappointment! The prospect of a painfree life without peak expediences - mere muzak and eating potatoes - sounds bleak. If a thought or deed causes distress, then other things being equal, that thought or deed is _not_ negative utilitarian. <br/><br/>3) You write, "Absolute NU is a devastatingly callous theory". No: NU, is a ridiculously compassionate theory. You are "callous" only if you are indifferent to someone's suffering, not if you don't act to amplify the well-being of the already happy or act to create happiness de novo.- although in practice, negative utilitarians should promote intelligent superhappiness too. Inducing sadness or disappointment is not NU. <br/><br/>[I think the force of your example depends on an untenable metaphysics of personal identity. If instead we use a more empirically supportable ontology of here-and-nows strung together in different sequences thanks to natural selection, no one is _harmed_ by waking up happy in the morning rather than superhappy like their namesake the night before. This is really an issue of population ethics, normally reckoned a different topic.)<br/><br/>Let us compare the callousness / compassion of classical utilitarianism and NU.<br/>Since we're doing thought-experiments, imagine if a magic genie offers me superexponential growth in my bliss at the price of exponential growth in your agony and despair. If I'm a classical utilitarian, then I am ethically bound to accept the genie's offer. Each year, your torment gets unspeakably worse as my bliss becomes ever more wonderful. Indeed, the thought I'm ethically doing the right thing increases my bliss even further! By generating so much net bliss, I'm the most saintly person who ever existed! If you knew how incredibly superhumanly, wonderful I'm feeling, then you'd realise that my superbliss easily offsets your tortured despair. Your tortured despair is a trivial _pinprick_ in comparison to my superexponentially growing bliss!<br/><br/>Of course, as a real-life negative utilitarian, I'd politely decline the genie's offer. <br/>But if you win me over to classical utilitarianism, I'll accept.<br/>Which is the callous choice?<br/>_____</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Some of the posts in this thread are really getting to some specific conceptions of measurement and the big picture of utilitarianism.  Given that we are getting very detailed, I'd like to scrutinize this statement:<br/><blockquote><div><cite>Pablo Stafforini wrote:</cite>(1) Positive and negative experiences are "polar opposites" of each other, in the sense that every positive experience has an intensity that is matched by the intensity of a given negative experience.  This is not an arbitrary artifact of the way we choose to measure the respective intensities of positive and negative experiences, but is rooted in the nature of the experiences themselves.  Just as a certain amount of positive charge is needed to cancel the negative charge of a subatomic particle, so similarly there is a certain intensity of positive experience that will "cancel" the intensity of a negative experience.<br/><br/>Brian denies this claim, and argues that semi-negative utilitarianism should not therefore be defined as the view that...<br/></div></blockquote><br/><br/>I would disagree.  What is consistent and objectively defined is the number line and the relationship between numbers on that line (or positive versus negative numbers of the same absolute value).  The arbitrary part is the assignment of particular events or experiences to particular values.  There is no objective theory that says that the spectrum must be balanced such that there is an equal number of items near -10 as there is near +10.  Perhaps the set of things near +10 is empty but the list of things near -10 is populated.  If you want to define your system such that "every positive experience has an intensity that is matched by the intensity of a given negative experience" then that is your choice--not an observation of a natural law of the universe.  I also doubt that there is even a rough estimate for some things: if one person is tortured and has his arm cut off, is that balanced by growing a third arm on some unsuspecting person?  If not, what is the exact opposite of cutting off a person's arm during torture?<br/><br/>My other comment pertains to how perceptions of one's own experiences manifest.  The process does not inherently pass through an assignment engine that maps experiences to a perfect number line.  There are collections of neurons firing--perhaps some of which lean toward pleasure and some that lean the other way, then (perhaps) a decision process in which a person makes a choice and perhaps sticks to the decision to avoid being called a flip-flopper (i.e., possible irrational processes or external influences).  If Person A gives more attention to negative experiences than Person B does, I cannot say that one is objectively wrong and the other is right because of how things map onto a number line.  When I consider things that affect me, I am closer to the negative utilitarian view than traditional utilitarian view (in part for different reasons not stated here).</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
