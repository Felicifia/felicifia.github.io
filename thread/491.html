In "<a class="postlink" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.3690">Thermodynamic constraints on neural dimensions, ﬁring rates,<br/>brain temperature and size</a>," Jan Karbowski presents a theoretical model according to which firing rates are slower in larger mammals. Using empirical cerebral glucose utilization rates, he calculates theoretical firing rates in Table 2 (p. 56):<br/><br/>Theoretical average firing rate by species<br/><ul><li> Mouse = 6.18 Hz</li><li> Rat = 5.03 Hz</li><li> Rabbit = 4.59 Hz</li><li> Cat = 4.47 Hz</li><li> Macaque = 2.38 Hz</li><li> Baboon = 2.33 Hz</li><li> Human = 1.68 Hz</li></ul>He adds, "estimated in such a way average ﬁring rates scale with gray matter volume with an exponent of<br/>−0.15 (Fig. 5C), implying that average activity in larger brains is slower than in smaller brains." I think this -0.15 exponent may have some relation to the same number in his 2007 article, "<a class="postlink" href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/18">Global and regional brain metabolic scaling and its functional consequences</a>"?<br/><br/>Caveats:<br/><ul><li> It seems these estimates are only based on a theory for how firing rates are determined by glucose utilization. It would be great to find empirical estimates of firing rates, because they are directly measurable.</li><li> These numbers are only for mammals. Would exothermic species have different patterns? For example, it seems perhaps implausible to suggest that firing rates for a grasshopper should be much bigger than for a mouse, because the grasshopper's overall metabolism is different.</li><li> The effect size isn't huge between species. Assuming we would use a linear weighting by average firing rate in welfare calculations, a mouse would only get 3.7 times the weight of a human. If the differences are indeed this small across species, then maybe clock speed isn't a high priority in the calculations.</li><li> Is "average neural firing rate" even a good proxy for "perceived rate of subjective experience"??</li></ul><br/>---<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">Update from 16 Feb. 2013</span>:<br/><br/>Jonatas Müller and David Pearce left <a class="postlink" href="http://www.facebook.com/brian.tomasik/posts/209336445878381">comments</a> when I shared this on my Facebook timeline.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

We could just ask whether a human in one point of reference matters less if the human is running slowly relative to another reference frame. I think it's clear that only subjective time matters here. Time is only relevant insofar as it describes what your brain can do in that time. If you're running slower, your brain can't do as much.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>DanielLC wrote:</cite>Also, if clock speed does matter, that means that having more computations in series matters. What about in parallel? Would a brain with twice as many neurons that fire just as often generate twice as much utility?</div></blockquote><br/>We've discussed many times my position that what matters is the portion of the brain's computations that produce subjective awareness of one's own emotional states -- the ability to feel them as good or bad. Presumably that process occupies a small subset of all neural processing. So extra parallel computation does count, but only if it enhances these conscious feelings. Doubling unconscious brain systems alone does not "double your pleasure, double your fun," so to speak.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

The same program may be run on computers of varying speeds and this would change the subjective duration of the associated experience.  However, the program itself wouldn't change, and as a consequence the quantity of pain contained in the experience would remain the same.  There would only be a difference in density of experience.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">I tried to search for more discussion of whether brains have something analogous to the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_signal">clock signal</a> of a computer. I didn't find a lot of results, and for those I did find, I couldn't assess whether they had relevance to this question. Following is one example.<br/><br/>"<a class="postlink" href="http://jn.physiology.org/content/77/4/2232.long">No Clock Signal in the Discharge of Neurons in the Deep Cerebellar Nuclei</a>":<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>We examined the spike activity of deep cerebellar nuclear cells recorded from awake, behaving monkeys to determine if there was a tendency for periodic discharge at or near 10 Hz. Data were obtained from four Rhesus monkeys trained to perform either targeted flexions and extensions of the wrist in relation to a visual cue (2 monkeys) or instrumented digit movements and natural reaches (2 monkeys). We determined the interspike intervals of 274 isolated cells. [...] Our failure to observe a clocklike timing signal in awake, behaving animals in either the Purkinje cell complex spike or the deep nuclear cell discharge argues against a popular idea that the inferior olive may act through the cerebellum as a motor clock.<br/></div></blockquote><br/><br/>For more intuition on what a clock signal does, I found <a class="postlink" href="http://www.designcabana.com/knowledge/electrical/electronics/digital/clock/">this explanation</a> helpful:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Digital circuits always have some input and generate digital outputs accordingly. Some digital circuits are not clocked, meaning that the input applied to the circuit flows through digital gates without any timing or storage and generates the output. It only takes a time equal to the propagation delay time to reach the output.<br/><br/>On the other hand most of the digital circuits that do more complex processing on the digital inputs such as controllers, processors or state machines are timed and the signal can't just go through. In these circuits a clock with a fixed frequency is used for timing. A clock plays very important role as it is used to open and close digital paths, allow or stop a process and in general provide timing for the circuit. You can compare a clock with the traffic lights.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>It certainly seems plausible that brains might benefit from a similar mechanism, but I don't know whether they actually do.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Reminds me of Pratchett's 'Bromeliad Triolgy'. The story revolves around a few communities of gnomes for whom time passes extremely slowly. So when they overhear humans, they hear something like, 'Dddddiiiiiiiiiddddddd yyyyyyoooooooouuuuuuu sssseeeeeeeee thhhaaaaaaaaattttt?'

I guess that means you read it just yesterday. (Your clock speed is 2000 times faster than normal.)</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
