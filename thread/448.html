<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">ive been reserching the possibility of insects being able to feel pain but really it is very difficult, are there any scientists or biologists or someone here who could point me in the direction of some information on how pain is felt because i feel i need a basic understanding in that area to really progress at this point.<br/><br/>some things people have said when ive emailed them:<br/><br/>"You could try searching on google. But most people won't answer this question <br/>because you can't get into an insect's head to determine whether they are feeling <br/>pain. However, their nervous systems are similar to ours, and many of the <br/>standard insecticides affect the nervous system. If you treat an insect or human <br/>with a chemical insecticide like parathion, the nerve impulses to the muscles <br/>stop - and both are killed - it's something like dying from cyanide - which can <br/>be painful for humans. But as I said initially, we just can say whether insects feel <br/>pain in the same way we do.<br/> <br/><br/>Hope this helps."<br/><br/><br/>another conversation:<br/><br/>Hello,<br/><br/>We here at the Lorquin Entomological Society do not promote the extermination of insects and spiders. We promote the study of natural methods to control and rid common household pests. You can contact a local extermination company for their insight about pesticide options.<br/><br/>Insects, like other animals, do have sensory capabilities to protect themselves. It is part of their evolutionary biology.  Humans feel pain as an unpleasant sensation to warn the rest of the body of potential damage. Humans experience pain most commonly on the surface of the skin. Insects have an exoskeleton so the distress they experience cannot be equated. Studies have shown that insects to exhibit distress that is comparable to the pain humans feel but there is no simple answer.<br/><br/>If you have anymore questions feel free to ask and I will direct you to someone that can provide a more detailed response on this topic. "<br/><br/><br/>basically what i seem to be finding is that no one knows because we cant talk to insects, but when people say no one knows the only reason we know other humans feel pain is that they say so and for animals that they writhe and move away from the source of pain and cry out and things like that and that they learn not to return to the source of pain which suggests very strongly to me that its not a reflex becuase they learned.<br/><br/>surely if we could find the point at which the mutation occoured that made it possible for things to feel pain we could say that everything that evolved from that can feel pain and the things before cannot, no?<br/><br/>thanks <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">I completely agree with your second post, Ruairi. I don't know which animals can suffer. The standard answer seems to be invertebrates and possibly some invertebrates.<br/>You might find help here: <a class="postlink" href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-animal/#currsci">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-animal/#currsci</a>,<br/>and you might want to seek further direction from Alan Dawrst from this very forum.<br/>Any public utilitarian ought to have something to say about this issue, so you'd be well within your rights contacting anyone from Peter Singer to Toby Ord to Torbjörn Tännsjö to Julian Savulescu.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Thanks for the great detective work, Ruairi! And like RyanCarey, I completely agree with your evolution point.<br/><br/>As for reading on the subject, you've likely come across my "<a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/insect-pain.html">Can Insects Feel Pain?</a>." One of the best citations within that piece is Section 2.1 - 2.4, pages 15-36 (PDF pages 62-84), of “<a class="postlink" href="http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/292.pdf">Aspects of the biology and welfare of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes</a>,” a lengthy document <a class="postlink" href="http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/scdocs/scdoc/292.htm">summarized here</a>. RyanCarey's suggested article is great as well, and Google has plenty more resources. Google Scholar is excellent; there are lots of very readable academic papers on animal-welfare measurement. Searches like "Can fish feel pain?" may bring up helpful discussions.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

However, it's quite possible that insects just aren't sensitive to that particular kind of bodily damage, although they are sensitive to others. Here's from Jennifer A. Mather's “<a class="postlink" href="http://www.rw.ttu.edu/ethics/pdf's/A6%20.pdf">Animal Suffering: An Invertebrate Perspective</a>”:<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Insects, for instance, can walk normally with a couple broken-off legs and survive with apparent unconcern as a parasite is eating them up inside, when presumably we would be in excruciating pain. Does that mean they cannot feel pain? I asked a friend who works with ants what she thought about this apparent inability to feel the pain we do. She said that she spilled a drop of acetone on an ant by accident one day and that it had recoiled and tried to wipe the substance off its abdomen. Maybe it is still pain, just responding to different stimuli. Alternately, maybe it is just an automatic grooming reaction. Because nuclear radiation can kill us without our feeling a thing, humans too do not always respond with pain to possible tissue destruction.</div></blockquote></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Hi Ruairi,<br/><br/>I agree with Torbjorn that learning isn't proof of being able to feel pain. As he says, computers can also learn. And it's also true that conscious experience isn't necessary for intelligent behavior; the phenomenon of <a class="postlink" href="http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/1676">blindsight</a> is a good illustration.<br/><br/>As I often say, the criterion that I think decides whether an organism deserves ethical consideration is whether it has self-reflective awareness of the "goodness" and "badness" of its own emotional states in a way that's "conscious," whatever that means exactly. (We have an intuitive sense of the concept, so we just need to pin down its "<a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_correlates_of_consciousness">neural correlates</a>," as they say, and understand the algorithms behind it.)<br/><br/>This is why I'm still not sure whether insects do suffer. However, insects are much closer to us than computers, and they exhibit many behaviors that look an awful lot like our own. See, e.g., this recent Wired article, "<a class="postlink" href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/06/honeybee-pessimism/">Honeybees Might Have Emotions</a>." Incidentally, the last two paragraphs seem relevant to our other discussions:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>In future studies, Bateson hopes to elicit from honeybees other forms of apparent emotion, such as happiness. She also wonders about the mental effects of chemicals and disease. <br/><br/>“It would be interesting to know if pesticides were altering their cognition, creating states similar to depression,” she said. <br/></div></blockquote></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Computers can learn things by being told, but this has nothing to do with classical conditioning, and thus doesn't generate pleasure or pain.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote><div><cite>DanielLC wrote:</cite>What exactly are you referring to?</div></blockquote><br/>Yes, I was referring to things like reinforcement learning (<a class="postlink" href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.67.5906">aka operant conditioning</a>?), perhaps like the Creatures example.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>DanielLC wrote:</cite>but in this case the issue is that we can't be sure they aren't generating pain.</div></blockquote><br/>I would guess that the algorithms aren't sufficiently close to what I think of as "conscious" mental processes that I wouldn't care about them. However, I would like to learn more about how they work! (So thanks for the reference.)<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>DanielLC wrote:</cite>It seems quite unlikely that it's impossible to program a computer to feel pain just because of its substrate</div></blockquote><br/>Agree.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>DanielLC wrote:</cite>so the only question to tell when the computer starts feeling pain is what exactly it takes, which brings us back to the original question. It's no easier to tell if a given program feels pain than it is to tell if an insect does.</div></blockquote><br/>Well, we can read the computer's source code, so we know exactly what algorithm it's using. That helps a lot in deciding whether we care about something. If there's no part of the algorithm that corresponds to the self-reflective process that we mean when we say "consciousness," then I wouldn't care about it. Of course, there's a lot of work yet to be done to figure out what algorithm it is in animals that brings about this consciousness. But I would guess the algorithm is hard to write, so I doubt humans have yet written programs that instantiate it.<br/><br/>Sorry for the hand-waviness. To some extent, "consciousness" is like "pornography" -- you know it when you see it. That said, our sentiments about exactly what processes count as conscious can be changed by intuition pumps.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

But for some reason, the passage of information along the new pathway (see the video for explanation) is conscious, but the passage of information along the old pathway is unconscious. So the story of consciousness has become more complicated. We need to explain why the passage of information through the old pathway is unconscious. <br/><br/>There is a broader question of consciousness vs reflexes. Like our old pathway, the nervous system that wraps around our gut, the enteric nervous system, seems not to communicate much with our conscious selves at all. It seems like everything it does is just an unconscious reflex. Like when I touch the tendon below my knee and I straighten it, without thinking or deciding to do so. If a creature was made up of just 'old pathways', then from a utilitarian point of view, they would not be morally important. Animals that have pathways that pathways that resemble our new one are animals that matter.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">I think there's also the possibility that consciousness is structured in different layers. Like there's a top layer consciousness which is our regular consciousness, but subsystems of our mind could have their own consciousness that doesn't communicate with the top level consciousness directly. What if certain "old pathways" in our mind are conscious after all, but not for "us"? Then there's also the question whether these partial consciousnesses can experience pain or pleasure.<br/><br/>Now I don't think that this is terribly likely, but I don't know how such a claim could be disproved.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">But Daniel, forget consciousness. Consider matter. I would consider that matter is continuous. But is that really a proper place for intuitions? Of course not. Whether matter is forever divisible is disproved by discovering a really small particle and trying really hard to divide it. It's a matter for science. Similarly, just because you and I think that consciousness ought to be continuous, doesn't make it true! <br/><br/>Do you agree or disagree?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Maybe guts all over the world are suffering in silence, with no way to bring an end to the pain because they have no control over the executive functions of their host organisms.

Elwood.pdf</a> ) has been posted already but what hes saying is very interesting, this bit is about crabs priorities:<br/><br/>"When shocks of a single intensity were applied, at<br/>a level that was hoped would not cause evacuation, some<br/>crabs evacuated and were more likely to do so from a less<br/>preferred shell species (Elwood and Appel 2009). Similarly,<br/>when the shocks increased in intensity, crabs evacuated the<br/>shell at a lower shock intensity if they were in a less preferred<br/>shell species (Appel and Elwood 2009b). Thus, the<br/>animals’ response to the shock was determined in part by<br/>their normal preference for particular species of shell. Further,<br/>they were much less likely to evacuate after being<br/>shocked when the odor of a predator was present, suggesting<br/>a tradeoff between shock avoidance and predator avoidance<br/>(Wilson and Elwood, unpublished observations). These responses<br/>cannot be a refl ex response as they required information<br/>from sources other than the noxious stimulus to have<br/>an effect on the response."<br/><br/>the guy who wrote the paper is in queens university belfast too! i could go there if i wanted <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/><br/><br/>edit: i dont suppose norns can do the kinda stuff hes talking about?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

So we'd run the liking circuits only. That's basically how I envision utilitronium: Efficient liking circuits running over and over, in the absence of desire. (Perhaps the Buddhist nirvana is similar?)</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2"><blockquote><div><cite>DanielLC wrote:</cite>How do you tell the difference between someone who likes something and someone who doesn't?<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Start with self-reports. See what brain processes are invoked during moments of reported liking. Then look for similar brain processes in animals that can't talk to us. Then, to create utilitronium, build efficient computational systems as close to that as possible.<br/><br/>Hopefully the "liking" process looks very different from the "disliking" process. If not, we'd need to be really careful, and maybe it would be safest not to try building them at all.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>DanielLC wrote:</cite>Would it be possible to make something fun, but anti-addictive</div></blockquote><br/>Sure. In theory, you could shut down the wanting system to prevent addiction but leave the liking system. I'm not sure if it could be done in practice (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.livestrong.com/article/206901-functions-of-a-dopamine-antagonist/">dopamine antagonists??</a>) in current minds or if you'd have to engineer the minds to be more resilient to this type of manipulation.<br/><br/>At least, we know of several instances in which people experience wanting without liking -- e.g., certain addictions.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

It wouldn't be as obvious as addiction, since you wouldn't do anti-addictive stuff, so it's not surprising that such a thing isn't well-known. If it exists, it's just a question of tuning it right to perfectly cancel out the wanting.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2"><blockquote><div><cite>DanielLC wrote:</cite>That would require them being so similar that we're actually more likely to be wrong than right.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Oh, I was speaking from my own negative-utilitarian-leaning perspective, according to which a few disliking computations are as bad as lots of liking computations are good. I would rather not risk it unless we're 99.99...% sure we're not creating disliking computations.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>DanielLC wrote:</cite>I meant turn on the reverse of addiction.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Maybe learned avoidance? Usually that's accompanied by intense disliking, but yeah, it probably is possible for an organism to avoid something without disliking that thing.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
