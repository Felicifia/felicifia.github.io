<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">B becomes better than A as soon as your donation can accomplish more impact than creating one vegetarian meal.<br/><br/>Given that, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/">according to my current guesses</a>, a vegetarian year can be created for $2.50 to $333, you should at first glance go for the factory-farmed meal / donation split as soon as the organic meal costs $0.91 more (one third of a vegetarian day at pessimistic assumptions, i.e. one meal).<br/><br/>However, this neglects the influence value (and health value) of being vegan, which, in my opinion, makes it better to be vegetarian.  It's a bit difficult to advocate for veganism while eating meat.<br/><br/>Lastly, this analysis also neglects the fact that, in practice, vegan meals are almost always cheaper than meat meals, so you can actually get a win-win scenario here.

I'm not sure what a good, safe assumption would be though.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>peterhurford wrote:</cite>It's a bit difficult to advocate for veganism while eating meat.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Good point. I used essentially this point in <a class="postlink" href="../thread/978.html#p8644">my post the other day</a>. I would like your opinion though, can you advocate veganism when eating a bit of dairy now and then? I suppose Peter Singer does it, but that is circumstantial (i.e. when he's at someones house, being fed).<br/><br/>Also, you suddenly switched from saying "vegan" then specifying "meat". Perhaps just a word choice issue.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>peterhurford wrote:</cite>Lastly, this analysis also neglects the fact that, in practice, vegan meals are almost always cheaper than meat meals, so you can actually get a win-win scenario here.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I would agree that vegan meals CAN be cheaper, but if you're strict, you lose a LOT of cheap options. Also, if you buy fake meats, that can be a bit pricey.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>peterhurford wrote:</cite>There's not much need to actually buy organic.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Agreed. though this could be a lengthy discussion. Are we morally obligated, then, to buy non-organic? It would seem so to me. what about the pesticides? Do they cause suffering? greater suffering that organic?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I'm just uncertain of how painful these methods are relative to each other. I see no reason why organic couldn't be more painful.

Freegan would work except that I do still pay for a large portion of my food so I'm sure that would upset the hardcore dumpster divers. Likewise vegan would upset a few. So far i've just said I don't pay for any animal products but if they are available for free i'll take them. Some people get it some don't. One thing I've found that helps people is to point out that even in the production of plant food alot of rodents die during harvesting and processing so by not throwing away that slice of pizza someone left behind I would be reducing the total amount of death/suffering. I might also try mentioning that using the money saved I can donate to a worthwhile cause( I haven't used this before because I'm extremely new to EA and before I had just been focused on reducing my personal contribution to suffering.)<br/><br/><br/>As for buying the non vegan food, I can't really see it working. Like Peter said most vegan meals are cheaper anyway and it is much harder to explain than not letting something go to waste.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Like Peter said most vegan meals are cheaper anyway and it is much harder to explain than not letting something go to waste.</div></blockquote><br/>I'm not really sure what you mean by "not see it working". It is based on the fact that I'm never going to be able to behave perfectly utilitarian, therefore would unnecessarily spend money on myself. Therefore, I could either go see a movie, or eat ice-cream and make a donation. When only considering first order effects, it should, moraly speaking, work dandy (from a utilitarian's moral perspective). However, complications arise when considering second or third order effects etc. (i.e. explaining to people or convincing people that they should do the same or similar)<br/>You can <a class="postlink" href="../thread/978.html">read my thread</a> to see how I would set it up.<br/><br/>Also, I noted that vegan meals are only cheaper under certain conditions (e.g. eating standards). Also, Peter said "meat" specifically, which is FAR easier to avoid than being a strict vegan (i.e. many cereals, much sugar[both noted in my thread], etc.). (I not sure if he meant to say "meat" or not)<br/><blockquote><div><cite>inQuestion wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>peterhurford wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>peterhurford wrote:</cite>Lastly, this analysis also neglects the fact that, in practice, vegan meals are almost always cheaper than meat meals, so you can actually get a win-win scenario here.</div></blockquote><br/>I would agree that vegan meals CAN be cheaper, but if you're strict, you lose a LOT of cheap options. Also, if you buy fake meats, that can be a bit pricey.<br/></div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br/><br/>Lastly, I would like to note that If I buy just cereals and sugary foods and the like, then it should be understandable and relatively easy to explain. On the other hand, if I buy animal products directly and yet proclaim to be some form of "vegan", though it may turn some people away, it could actually help insofar as it will peek people's interest.<br/>What do you think about this? I suppose people are pretty hard to predict. Perhaps I should try it sometime and see what the effects are?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I'm not really sure what you mean by "not see it working".</div></blockquote> <br/><br/>Yea I guess I should have said I can't see myself doing this.<br/><br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Lastly, I would like to note that If I buy just cereals and sugary foods and the like, then it should be understandable and relatively easy to explain.</div></blockquote> <br/><br/>Yea I imagine most people wouldn't even notice you eating a sugary cereal, I doubt many outside of vegan circles even know about the bone char or various minerals. A gallon of milk might be a different story though.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>On the other hand, if I buy animal products directly and yet proclaim to be some form of "vegan", though it may turn some people away, it could actually help insofar as it will peek people's interest.<br/>What do you think about this?

Perhaps I should try it sometime and see what the effects are?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I try to avoid using the word vegan when describing myself because I find this does turn people off when I mention that I would eat meat that was going to be thrown out anyway. This would apply even more so in your situation, I think maybe just say I don't buy much meat/cheese/milk and I try to donate some money for each purchase when I do. I've heard some people call themselves flexitarian which means they occasionally eat non vegan/veggie stuff but I find this to be an awkward and uncomfortable word. In theory it opens up a discussion about the broader topic of utilitarianism versus deontological veganism which could be a good thing, except I think in general people don't get it. And the ones who do you probably could have brought it up somehow anyway.<br/><br/>tldr: If that's what you gotta do go for it, but my one piece of advice which I think would be most useful is to avoid the veg*an words and just go straight to saying something about util/consequences.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I would probably still explain to people that I'm not against it morally, but for consistency I think I'm just going to go without. Can I ask why you chose to include dairy and animal products? Also what animal products did you mean, ie like leather or just the small stuff like vitamin d3 in cereal?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
