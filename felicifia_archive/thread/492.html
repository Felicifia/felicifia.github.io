<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Below are some sobering selections from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.psychforums.com/antisocial-personality/topic71578.html">one PsychForums discussion</a>. Despite being alarmed by the participants, my heart goes out to them. I'm sure they suffer a lot in their own lives as well.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I have a secret phobia of water so I've fantasized about drowning people, or at least killing people and then disposing of their bodies in bodies of water such as lakes or ponds. There is something very disturbing about a body in water for me. My conscience does not kick in thinking about a little girl drowning but I can see why it would for you crystal. It would gross if I ever found a little dead girl floating in water but it would also fascinate me. <br/><br/>I have another instance where I realized I enjoyed the suffering of others, killing fish when I was a little kid, torturing them to death with hooks, knives, and fire was fun for me. I never treated my pets like that but wild animals were fair game. Also in elementary school I kicked one of my best friends in the crotch and I thought it was hilarious the way he dropped to the ground so quickly and almost threw up. I was ecstatically amused by that, I'm surprised he forgave me.<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>You know what, I actually used to torture my babysitter's cats. And in elementary school I kicked this older person I was bullying so hard in the balls he had to go to hospital<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>I have a new neighbor right now who is now on the verge of being fired from her job because of me I also trapped and re-homed her cat, she started harassing me within 30 minutes of their moving truck pulling up so she had it coming. Must feed the beast to keep it full and content reducing the risk of it attacking unprovoked.<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>You're entitled to your opinions and questions; but don't come into a safe zone for us to look at these things without judgement and condemnment, [...] because you'll just make the creatures in this forum very aggressive  <img alt=":twisted:" src="../images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif"/>  you're kinda new here, which makes you fresh meat for the beasts- so... do you really wanna start off like this???<br/><br/> <img alt=":D" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif"/>  This is gonna be FUN!!!! !!  <img alt=":twisted:" src="../images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif"/> <br/></div></blockquote></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I vaguely remember seeing something saying this sort thing might be genetic (partially). Technically, the "abusive childhood" hypothesis isn't the only one that fits the data. Genes could make sure psychopathic parents had psychopathic kids - which they beat for the fun of it. Selecting against psychopaths seems best.<br/><br/>Yes!

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="4">I think it's a coincidence. I searched for generally interesting lecture series online and found his to be very worthwhile. Before that, I had only seen one of his talks via TED (about how humans are different from other primates).<br/><br/>He makes an interesting point about sociopaths in the Aggression III video at 41:45, claiming that they (or some of them?) have a high threshold for pain experience, resulting in reduced empathy. If this is indeed a linear correlation that cannot be easily broken apart, then any enhancement to reduce pain in humans could reduce empathy as well, and any enhancement in empathy could increase pain sensitivity. Certainly not a welcome side-effect. Ideally, what you want is empathetic rational humans who suffer only rarely or not intensely.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Sounds rather plausible.<br/><br/>Here's a copy of a post I wrote on the Old Felicifia. I extracted the text from the archive of old diaries that Seth Baum gave me.<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Less Suffering, Less Empathy?<br/>by: Brian Tomasik<br/>Wed Nov 07, 2007 at 17:45:43 PM UTC<br/><br/>From personal experience I know that I tend to care most about the suffering of others after experiencing painful events myself. When I go for long periods of time without feeling much pain, my motivations can drift away from suffering toward other concerns (including non-utilitarian ones). I'm often less concerned about making sure that my actions strictly maximize expected value when I'm in a <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthymia_(medicine)">euthymic</a> state.<br/><br/>As human lives become increasingly comfortable, and as--perhaps--society becomes more accepting of mood-enhancing drugs, is there a danger that people will generally become less concerned about the suffering of those who still endure significant amounts of pain (most notably <a class="postlink" href="http://utilitarian-essays.com/wild-animals.pdf">wild animals</a> and, possibly, <a class="postlink" href="http://utilitarian-essays.com/humane-insecticides.html">insects</a>)?<br/><br/>Are there studies (or anecdotal accounts) of whether people become more empathetic after painful experiences? Is the correlation between empathy and euthymia positive or negative? Perhaps one could argue that, even if depressed people are more concerned about the suffering of others, non-depressed people are more likely to actually do something about it? [Cf. the saying, "Pessimists are more accurate, but optimists get more done."]<br/><br/>A related concern is whether improvements in mood would cause people to become less rational regarding factual beliefs. The evidence on <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depressive_realism">depressive realism</a> is mixed, and even if true, the finding relates mainly to beliefs about one's own abilities. Moreover, correlation doesn't prove causation--who wouldn't become more depressed as a result of accurately viewing the world? <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/> Still, it seems plausible that people in good moods will be more prone to <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias">optimism bias</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_effect">valence effects</a>, and <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishful_thinking">wishful thinking</a>. This is obviously of concern regarding <a class="postlink" href="../thread/561.html">how good we think the post-human future will be</a>, as well as other areas.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>At least two of my animal-activist friends said they have experienced intense physical pain in their lives, and I think this has contributed to where they are today. I, too, had significant physical pain for several years. When I was 15, I developed -- for some reason that still remains unknown -- a condition called esophagitis. When I ate, I felt immediately full and nauseous, although I never actually vomited. For 2-3 hours after eating, in fact, the pain was so bad that I paced around my room, squeezing my chair, and waiting for the feeling to subside.<br/><br/>After a few episodes of this, I learned not to eat at all. I managed to eat one oyster cracker or spoonful of cereal every hour throughout the day, but that was all I could stomach; even drinking more than a few sips of water was painful. This continued for ~2-3 months. I had lost an ordinary sense of hunger, but I was weak and unable to do much of anything besides reading or watching TV.<br/><br/>Eventually my gastroenterologist identified my esophagitis via endoscopy and prescribed Nexium. This helped a lot, and eventually I returned to being able to eat small amounts. However, esophageal irritation continued after meals for 4-5 years afterward, although it was worst the first 1-2 years following my initial recovery. I dreaded car trips, because they were typically hours on end of waiting, waiting, waiting for the agony to stop.<br/><br/>In the last ~4 years, esophageal irritation has gone away completely. My life is currently as pain-free as ever, and I'm as happy as I can ever remember being. Yet my empathy has not waned (I don't think). This is a hopeful partial reply to the hypothesis of an inherent pain-empathy link. One reason that I still care even though I'm not in pain may be that I'm so wrapped up in projects like Felicifia and working with animal activists on a regular basis. Doing things to help others doesn't require special effort; it's just a part of life that I take for granted. Perhaps pain-inspired empathy would be more important if this kind of work required a big shift in my life plans.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Now that fraction is probably lower (maybe 70%?).

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="4">That people who suffer more are more empathetic is an interesting hypothesis. It would be pretty easy to match a few dozen people with chronic pain to a few dozen controls and give them a personality test. I guess this hasn't been done, though.<br/><br/>I have a form of arthritis called ankylosing spondylitis. It caused pain and stiffness in my hips and back for several years. Now I'm on a medication and have virtually zero pain. It might have been edifying to have some days with a negative hedonic balance. Perhaps primed me to believe that, e.g., the prancing deer and smiling dolphins might not be so happy after all. You can remind yourself that there's a lot of suffering in the world by watching videos of it, but that's voluntary and aversive, so you're not likely to do it. Having pain yourself is more visceral, and you can't look away.<br/><br/>The most motivated civil-rights activists were black, and the most motivated women's-rights activists were women, so maybe experiencing something bad yourself motivates you to fix it. Of course, the demographic makeup of civil- and women's-rights activists could be explained equally well by self-interest. Honestly, I have no idea whether my condition had any effect on my ethical beliefs or actions.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

We project our emotional states onto those we see. This is part of the reason I worry that we well-fed, safe, healthy humans in comfortable temperature-controlled houses under-appreciate the amount of suffering in the wild. (The other main reason being that most animals have short lifespans and are more <span style="font-style: italic">r</span>-selected than humans.)<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Pat wrote:</cite>You can remind yourself that there's a lot of suffering in the world by watching videos of it, but that's voluntary and aversive, so you're not likely to do it.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Moreover, because we project our past/present emotions onto what we see, we might not realize how bad the things in the video really are. I remember being a young kid -- before I had experienced much pain that I could remember -- watching a video of people being decapitated, and I thought nothing of it. It wasn't much different watching the head fall off the body than watching a rock fall off a cliff. Similarly, I used to watch tons of nature shows (like ~1-2 hours per week for several years) but never thought about the agony endured by the prey. I just enjoyed the excitement of the chase, as though I was watching a video game.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Pat wrote:</cite>Of course, the demographic makeup of civil- and women's-rights activists could be explained equally well by self-interest.</div></blockquote><br/>Well, not personal self-interest. The effort and risk required to participate in those movements was high, while the expected benefits of an individual's contribution at the margin was minuscule. It could have been in the self-interest of the group as a whole, though. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/><br/><br/>In general, any political participation is almost never in one's individual self-interest.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Below are some quotes from the paper that I found worth sharing.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The connection between totalitarian goals and totalitarian methods is straightforward.  People do not want to radically change their behavior.  To make them change anyway requires credible threats of harsh punishment – and the main way to make such threats credible is to carry them out on a massive scale. (p. 1)<br/></div></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>But despite historians' focus on Russia and Germany, Maoist China was actually responsible for more civilian killings than the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany put together.  Modern estimates put its death toll at 65 million. (Margolin 1999a)  The West is primarily familiar with the cruelties inflicted on Chinese intellectuals and Party members during the Cultural Revolution, but its death toll was probably under 1 million.  The greatest of Mao's atrocities was the Great Leap Forward, which claimed 30 million lives through man-made starvation. (Becker 1996) (p. 3)<br/></div></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>For goals that can be achieved by brute force or mobilizing resources, totalitarian methods have proven highly effective.  For example, Stalin was able to develop nuclear weapons with amazing speed simply by making this the overarching priority of the Soviet economy. (Holloway 1994) (p. 4)<br/></div></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>It is tempting for Westerners to argue that the Soviet Union and Maoist China changed course because their systems proved unworkable, but this is fundamentally incorrect.  These systems were most stable when their performance was worst.  Communist rule was very secure when Stalin and Mao were starving millions to death.  Conditions were comparatively good when reforms began.  Totalitarianism ended not because totalitarian policies were unaffordable, but because new leaders were unwilling to keep paying the price in lives and wealth. (p. 7)<br/></div></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Totalitarianism would be much more stable if there were no non-totalitarian world.  The worse-case scenario for human freedom would be a global totalitarian state.  Without an outside world for comparison, totalitarian elites would have no direct evidence that any better way of life was on the menu.  It would no longer be possible to borrow new ideas from the non-totalitarian world, but it would also no longer be necessary.  The global government could economically and scientifically stagnate without falling behind. (p. 9)<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Maybe scientific stagnation wouldn't be so bad on balance, if it would prevent a Singularity and attendant explosion of computational power that could be used to create orders of magnitude more suffering. However, if the totalitarian state eventually did develop AGI, the situation would get very dire. <img alt=":(" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif"/><br/><br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>In Orwell's 1984, one of the few scientific questions still being researched is "how to discover, against his will, what another human being is thinking." (1983: 159)  Advances in brain research and related fields have the potential to do just this.  Brain scans, for example, might one day be used to screen closet skeptics out of the party.  Alternately, the new and improved psychiatric drugs of the future might increase docility without noticeably reducing productivity. (pp. 11-12)<br/></div></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>At the same time, it should be acknowledged that some of these technologies might lead totalitarianism to be less violent than it was historically.  Suppose psychiatric drugs or genetic engineering created a docile, homogeneous population.  Totalitarian ambitions could then be realized without extreme brutality, because people would want to do what their government asked – a possibility explored at length in the dystopian novel Brave New World. (Huxley 1996) (p. 13)<br/></div></blockquote><br/>This is a comforting thought. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/><br/><br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>How seriously do I take the possibility that a world totalitarian government will emerge during the next one thousand years and last for a thousand years or more?  Despite the complexity and guesswork inherent in answering this question, I will hazard a response.  My unconditional probability – i.e., the probability I assign given all the information I now have - is 5%. (p. 20)<br/></div></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>(pp. 20-21) Finally, it is tempting to minimize the harm of a social disaster like totalitarianism, because it would probably not lead to human extinction.  Even in Cambodia, the totalitarian regime with the highest death rate per-capita, 75% of the population remained alive after three years of rule by the Khmer Rouge. (Margolin 1999b)  But perhaps an eternity of totalitarianism would be worse than extinction.  It is hard to read Orwell and not to wonder:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we are creating?  It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that the old reformers imagined.  A world of fear and treachery and torment, a world of trampling and being trampled upon, a world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself.  Progress in our world will be progress towards more pain. (1983: 220)<br/></div></blockquote><br/></div></blockquote></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

It tolerates bullying, mocking, and teasing, labeling the victim as psychopathic when acting out after provoked.<br/><br/>The real problem in such an instance is the victim is being tortured by psychopaths, but because psychopaths aren't acting out strongly enough, society doesn't care.  It only cares about the provoked victim retaliating, especially when the victim can't communicate why things happened because of intimidation.<br/><br/>It's with no surprise that psychopaths approve of retribution.  Their goal is to get people in trouble, and they want the excuse to harm others when affected.<br/><br/>This is one of the reasons I can't embrace utilitarianism at all.  A utilitarian solution to the above would involve institutionalizing victims, not psychopaths.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Han Fei was sick and tired of corruption, so he designed a system of harsh punishment meant to PREVENT psychopaths from achieving power through secrecy.<br/><br/>The system immensely backfired, and for centuries, China was locked in civil war among dynasties competing for the mandate of heaven.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="5"><blockquote><div><cite>Akeron wrote:</cite>Psychopathy is not just about emotions. It's also possible for people to be emotionally different, but not anti-social. The problem is when people let their emotions get out of control by believing it's OK to force others to endure them.<br/><br/>The thread also only looks at extreme examples of psychopathy, and society gets away with this tremendously. It tolerates bullying, mocking, and teasing, labeling the victim as psychopathic when acting out after provoked.<br/></div></blockquote><br/><br/>The first paragraph in the quote above makes several claims.  I would agree that people can be emotionally different and not anti-social, and that problem can be caused when people "let their emotions get out of control."  <br/><br/>The last part of the first paragraph in the quote is a claim that the cause of the problems stems from a belief about forcing other people to do things.  The second paragraph makes another claim that the cause of the problem stems from people being provoked.  These things might be associated with problems, but they are not diagnostic of psychopathy.<br/><br/>Psychopathy is a clinical diagnosis made by psychologists, although the media might stretch the meaning of the word. The main components of psychopathy are a lack of empathy for others and lack of self control characterized by impulsive acts that harm others.  You can read a bit about it here:   <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy</a>.  Other studies have proposed a more detailed view: Antisocial Behavior, Impulsive Thrill-Seeking, Interpersonal Manipulation, and Cold Affect.<br/><br/>When the signs of psychopathy are not extreme in young people, the diagnosis might be conduct disorder, meaning that psychopathy is relative extreme by definition.<br/><br/>What you described are examples of real events that do happen, but the explanation of the causes describe something different than the characteristics that uniquely identify true psychopaths.  That is not to say that psychopaths do not react when they feel slighted (they do) but others might react strongly in a similar situation without being psychopaths.  The psychopath is much more likely to go on a killing rampage because of the combination of attributes that characterize psychopaths.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="5">I came across the song "Little Piece of Heaven" (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/a/avenged_sevenfold/a_little_piece_of_heaven.html">lyrics</a>), which is one of a plenitude of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.teenspot.com/boards/showthread.php?489528-The-most-disgusting-lyrics">utterly disgusting</a> songs. (I don't recommend watching the video.)<br/><br/>I know there's a lot of discussion about whether violence in entertainment leads to violence in real life, with arguments going both ways. Still, I find it sort of odd that authorities don't even think twice about people listening to these kinds of things, while at the same time we regard it as thoroughly tragic (and even traumatic) when they happen in real life. Ted Bundy is often regarded as essentially evil incarnate. Are people really that good at separating make-believe from the real world?<br/><br/>Related -- "<a class="postlink" href="http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=592122">Wanted: a sensible explanation of why parents don't want kids exposed to sex but violence is okay</a>":<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Working at a national video game retailer I had to deal with this all the time.<br/><br/>"Ma'am, I'm required to let you know that this game is rated M for mature for violence, blood and gore, alcohol, drug use, simulated gambling-"<br/>"Yeah, yeah, yeah."<br/>"- and partial nudity."<br/>"WHAT?!"<br/>"Partial nudity."<br/>"OH HELL NO!"<br/><br/>My explaining to them that "partial nudity" means girls in bikinis typically didn't change their minds.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="5"><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=girl-buried-alive-in-honor-killing-2010-02-04">A sickening story</a>:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>A 16-year-old girl was buried alive by relatives in southeastern Turkey in a gruesome honor killing carried out because she reportedly befriended boys, the Anatolia news agency reported Thursday. [...]<br/><br/>A subsequent postmortem examination revealed that M.M. had a significant amount of soil in her lungs and stomach, indicating that she was buried alive and conscious, forensic experts told the news agency. “The autopsy result is blood-curdling. According to our findings, the girl – who had no bruises on her body and no sign of narcotics or poison in her blood – was alive and fully conscious when she was buried,” one anonymous expert said. [...]<br/><br/>Police had found the body of the girl using an anonymous tip saying that M.M. had been killed based on a decision by a family council and buried under the chicken pen, daily Milliyet reported. [...]<br/><br/>Family councils consist of family elders; honor killings are usually decided by such groups.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>I find it remarkable how different cultures/subcultures within the same species (humans) can have such different dynamics for responding to internal conflicts. If this had happened to, say, the daughter of Jimmy Carter, the response would have been a world apart. (Setting aside the fact that what the girl did wasn't even wrong.) Perhaps some of these differences are genetic, but probably many are cultural and developmental.<br/><br/>"<a class="postlink" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC387823/">Emergence of a Peaceful Culture in Wild Baboons</a>":<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Primates exhibit a wide range of behaviors, not just among species but also among populations and even individuals. Yet the nature versus nurture debate still rages, particularly when it comes to understanding the roots of aggression. While bonobos are famous for using sex to resolve disputes, aggression is far more common in most primate species—again humans included. Our closest relative, the chimpanzee, has a reputation for being among the most belligerent, with rhesus monkeys and baboons not far behind. [...]<br/><br/>Primatologists characterize these behavioral differences as “cultural” traits, since they arise independent of genetic or environmental factors and are not only shared by a population (though not necessarily a species) but are also passed on to succeeding generations. [...]<br/><br/>In his book <span style="font-style: italic">A Primate's Memoir</span>, Sapolsky studied the activities and lifestyle of the Forest Troop to explore the relationship between stress and disease. In typical baboon fashion, the males behaved badly, angling either to assume or maintain dominance with higher ranking males or engaging in bloody battles with lower ranking males, which often tried to overthrow the top baboon by striking tentative alliances with fellow underlings. Females were often harassed and attacked. Internecine feuds were routine. Through a heartbreaking twist of fate, the most aggressive males in the Forest Troop were wiped out. The males, which had taken to foraging in an open garbage pit adjacent to a tourist lodge, had contracted bovine tuberculosis, and most died between 1983 and 1986. Their deaths drastically changed the gender composition of the troop, more than doubling the ratio of females to males, and by 1986 troop behavior had changed considerably as well; males were significantly less aggressive.<br/><br/>After the deaths, Sapolsky stopped observing the Forest Troop until 1993. Surprisingly, even though no adult males from the 1983–1986 period remained in the Forest Troop in 1993 (males migrate after puberty), the new males exhibited the less aggressive behavior of their predecessors. Around this time, Sapolsky and Share also began observing another troop, called the Talek Troop. The Talek Troop, along with the pre-TB Forest Troop, served as controls for comparing the behavior of the post-1993 Forest Troop. The authors found that while in some respects male to male dominance behaviors and patterns of aggression were similar in both the Forest and control troops, there were differences that significantly reduced stress for low ranking males, which were far better tolerated by dominant males than were their counterparts in the control troops. The males in the Forest Troop also displayed more grooming behavior, an activity that's decidedly less stressful than fighting. Analyzing blood samples from the different troops, Sapolsky and Share found that the Forest Troop males lacked the distinctive physiological markers of stress, such as elevated levels of stress-induced hormones, seen in the control troops.<br/><br/>In light of these observations, the authors investigated various models that might explain how the Forest Troop preserved this (relatively) peaceful lifestyle, complete with underlying physiological changes. One model suggests that nonhuman primates acquire cultural traits through observation. Young chimps may learn how to crack nuts with stones by watching their elders, for example. In this case, the young baboon transplants might learn that it pays to be nice by watching the interactions of older males in their new troop. Or it could be that proximity to such behavior increases the likelihood that the new males will adopt the behavior. Yet another explanation could be that males in troops with such a high proportion of females become less aggressive because they don't need to fight as much for female attention and are perhaps rewarded for good behavior. But it could be that the females had a more direct impact: new male transfers in the Forest Troop were far better received by resident females than new males in the other troops.<br/><br/>Sapolsky and Share conclude that the method of transmission is likely either one or a combination of these models, though teasing out the mechanisms for such complex behaviors will require future study. But if aggressive behavior in baboons does have a cultural rather than a biological foundation, perhaps there's hope for us as well.<br/></div></blockquote></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="5">Luckily, dolorium is quite an abstract concept that may not trigger ordinary sadistic or violent impulses. At the very least, it is improbable that large quantities trigger them linearly stronger than smaller quantities. For instance, sexual sadism probably requires personal attention space with the typical display of pain, fear, disgust etc. It is relatively unlikely that a particularly powerful post-singularity sexual sadist would multiply the number of their victims with something like 10^6, while it is entirely realistic that a particularly powerful utilitarian would do the same for pleasure.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="5">It could become fashionable for a subset of individuals in a world in which people don't have the power to monitor and stop each other's actions. The story <a class="postlink" href="http://localroger.com/prime-intellect/mopiidx.html">The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect</a> depicts such a world: Humans cannot hurt each other without consent, and they can't die at all, but non-humans are fair game and each human gets enormous resources to create whatever they want. The story describes how factory farms vanish but many new planets with wild animals come into being, and some humans sometimes torture animals as a part of entertainment (the story mostly depicts consensual violence between humans).<br/><br/>I think it would look different if people could interfere with each other. So we have laws against animal cruelty, even though they are far from perfect. And all of that could go out the window if self-modification technologies allow people to switch off empathy, which is already relatively weak. If there turns out to be some good reason to do that, this could do a lot of additional harm.<br/><br/>I think for most current people, neither hedonium nor dolorium would be on the wish list for a post-Singularity world. There would probably be some hell worlds, but most of them would not be optimized to create absolute maximum suffering. There would probably be aesthetic or narrative elements that decrease efficiency considerably. OTOH, I would predict the same for the pleasure side. There would be paradises but not many hedonium clusters.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

In most cases, empathy drags you down. For example, few predators feel empathy for their prey. The main case in which empathy might be useful is when interacting with peers who have similar power as you do, so that you can establish trusting relationships. Empathy for those weaker than you is an unfortunate side-effect as far as survival is concerned.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Hedonic Treader wrote:</cite>OTOH, I would predict the same for the pleasure side.

But it has one advantage: It's aversive to resource waste, since for agents with these preferences, marginal utility of resources doesn't decrease with availability of resources (because they could always simulate more concurrent happy copies). This would lead to more motivation to use the resources to create happiness instead of wasting them or allowing suffering beings to exist.<br/><br/>Let's say you have a nature-lover who cares far more about his happiness than about anything else. Let's say that person is very wealthy and powerful. If he were poor, he'd make himself happy efficiently, but since he has extra resources, he sponsors vast wildlife in addition. Now compare this to the same guy, with the same preferences, except he can copy himself, make the copies happy and count them in his 'egoism'.

If I die this night, my future selves won't exist. Most people usually don't want to die any time soon. Living longer is seen as better, even though from a current perspective, there is no prior-existence of any future self.<br/><br/>Now some people may think about copying as being fundamentally different from survival, but I think most analytical people who take the scientific evidence seriously will have to concede that survival is basically a form of metabolic self-copying into the future. One who cares about these types of future self-copies, e.g. by desiring a long life expectancy, and who takes this view seriously, could increase life expectancy considerably by running concurrent copies. But maybe most people won't take it seriously because their self-concepts are evolved to deal with sequential survival rather than concurrent copying.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Maybe you could make the case that those minds which are motivated to create more copies of themselves will be the ones that try to expand, so there will be a lot more of them than the single-copy people.

<p class="author"><img alt="Post" height="9" src="../styles/nexus/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" title="Post" width="11"/>by <strong><a href="../user/64.html">Brian Tomasik</a></strong> on 2012-12-15T06:20:00</p>
<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">A <a class="postlink" href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/allinthemind/the-science-of-compassion/4405514">moving interview</a> with James Doty of CCARE on the excellent podcast, All in the Mind.<br/><br/>I didn't agree with everything James said. For example:<br/><ul><li> In discussing an elderly-longevity study, his explanation confounded correlation with causation.</li><li> He seemed to suggest that liberal policies must be better just because they're more compassionate, which ignores the possibility that seemingly non-compassionate institutions could potentially yield better outcomes.</li><li> I also worry that compassion without rationality may lead merely to more short-sighted charity -- e.g., volunteer work, which he mentioned in the interview, or "random acts of kindness," which are endorsed by his <a class="postlink" href="http://ccare.stanford.edu/project-compassion">Project Compassion</a> -- to the detriment of <a class="postlink" href="http://80000hours.org/blog/113-find-the-gate">long-term, indirect thinking</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/triage.html">cost-effectiveness analysis</a>.</li></ul><br/>Things I liked:<br/><ul><li> James's passion for the cause and his touching stories.</li><li> James mentioned that training courses help extend compassion to "essentially all humans and sentient beings," not just all humans.</li><li> James explains that many so-called criminals could have turned out differently if people had shown compassion to them. (Not all, of course. Sometimes genes play a strong role too.) One of the best episodes of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood is the "Spoon Mountain Opera" (<a class="postlink" href="http://pbskids.org/rogers/videos/index.html?pid=Ls4_H0J5fo78WAsMO0lEuiMn8yYFTdeM">full episode</a>). It centers on this topic, especially the song "All I Ever Wanted was a Spoon" (19:00 - 20:45). Speaking of altruism for animals, see also "It Doesn't Matter Who's in Trouble" (11:55 - 12:25).</li></ul><br/>Some quotes from the interview with James:<br/><ul><li> "And it also allowed me to explore something that had always been of interest to me, which is to understand why when people see somebody suffering they don’t intervene to help them. You know people who by every criteria have the capacity to do so, whether it’s by position, whether it’s by financial resources...and they just watch people suffer. Yet the paradox of this of course is you see people who they themselves are suffering or are poor yet they reach out. And so that paradox had stayed with me so once I had made these donations then it allowed me to start exploring that, and I had left Stanford and I came back and that’s when this exploration had started, with collaborating with some scientists."</li><li> "I’m interested actually in the neural pathways and there are multiple ones. Of course we know about oxytocin or the bonding hormone, it turns out if you give intra-nasal oxytocin to an individual they have this incredible sense of connection to people, but only within their in-group. So the key is how do you expand that in-group to a larger circle if you will? So that’s an area of interest Dave DeSteno actually at Northeastern in the US, he’s actually doing work that shows that if you can take somebody who you don’t see as in your in-group and then look at them and try to sit there and say, is there one thing we have in common? And then you start trying to go down a list, and then you realise that there are probably multiple things. Each time you do that it actually decreases the sense of separateness."</li><li> "We actually have begun some very interesting work that has some extraordinary results at Stanford where we actually turn on and off some of the genes of nurturing utilising the technique of giving these rodents certain viruses, and then attaching on to these genes these chemo-luminescent substances that in the face of certain wavelengths of light can turn on and off the genes. It’s amazing some of the behaviours that you can see. And in fact maybe it’s even frightening though because it shows you how you can manipulate certain types of behaviours."</li><li> "When you care for somebody in an authentic way, deep in your heart it stays with you and you can relive it and it makes you want to do it again to somebody else. And you know I call that transcendence, it is a sense that you have a purpose in life, that the act of connecting with another defines your purpose, that we're in fact all one. And when you have that sense, that is the thing that gives you happiness and joy. And it’s not that it gives you that big kick like driving that Ferrari, or picking up the Ferrari, or getting the new Prada purse or whatever...those are short term things. The things I am describing to you I think you will acknowledge are things that stick with you at a very deep level and it defines our humanity and who we are. And showing people the value proposition of those types of behaviours is very powerful."</li></ul></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<p class="author"><img alt="Post" height="9" src="../styles/nexus/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" title="Post" width="11"/>by <strong><a href="../user/64.html">Brian Tomasik</a></strong> on 2012-12-16T00:15:00</p>
<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">A friend pointed me to an excellent article by David Brooks, "<a class="postlink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/opinion/brooks-the-limits-of-empathy.html">The Limits of Empathy</a>." Brooks writes:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>People who are empathetic are more sensitive to the perspectives and sufferings of others. They are more likely to make compassionate moral judgments.<br/><br/>The problem comes when we try to turn feeling into action. Empathy makes you more aware of other people’s suffering, but it’s not clear it actually motivates you to take moral action or prevents you from taking immoral action.<br/><br/>In the early days of the Holocaust, Nazi prison guards sometimes wept as they mowed down Jewish women and children, but they still did it. Subjects in the famous Milgram experiments felt anguish as they appeared to administer electric shocks to other research subjects, but they pressed on because some guy in a lab coat told them to.<br/><br/>Empathy orients you toward moral action, but it doesn’t seem to help much when that action comes at a personal cost.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Another example could be the <a class="postlink" href="http://faculty.babson.edu/krollag/org_site/soc_psych/darley_samarit.html">"Good Samaritan" study</a>, where the amount of hurriedness by the subjects had a bigger effect than the moral salience of what they were thinking about.<br/><br/>These claims are generally true. I don't deny that other factors -- including, as Brooks mentions, finding a dime in a phone booth -- can have bigger short-term influences. However, there are a few things to say about this.<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">(1) People vary in how much they're affected by empathy</span><br/><br/>Brooks says:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>You may feel a pang for the homeless guy on the other side of the street, but the odds are that you are not going to cross the street to give him a dollar.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>This may be true for most people but not for everyone. I personally have walked across across the street several times to help a poor person buy food. In fact, I did so somewhat against my better judgment, because I knew theoretically that the money was better spent helping animals, but I didn't want to become cold-hearted. I have also spent hours and hours squishing <a class="postlink" href="http://reducing-suffering.blogspot.com/2009/03/worms-in-rain.html">dying worms in the rain</a> out of concern for them. I would not have done this without feeling empathy.<br/><br/>So, just as I can <a class="postlink" href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/">generalize from one example</a> by seeing a close link between empathy and action, so too Brooks may be doing the same in his case when not seeing such a link. I think the truth is that different people vary.<br/><br/>Brooks goes on to say:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>There have been piles of studies investigating the link between empathy and moral action. Different scholars come to different conclusions, but, in <a class="postlink" href="http://subcortex.com/IsEmpathyNecessaryForMoralityPrinz.pdf">a recent paper</a>, Jesse Prinz, a philosopher at City University of New York, summarized the research this way: “These studies suggest that empathy is not a major player when it comes to moral motivation. Its contribution is negligible in children, modest in adults, and nonexistent when costs are significant.” Other scholars have called empathy a “fragile flower,” easily crushed by self-concern.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>So as he admits in the second sentence, some studies have reached the conclusion that empathy matters. And even though empathy is easily crushed, that doesn't mean it always is. Sometimes people aren't in a hurry. Sometimes they aren't pressured by an experimenter to shock a victim. Sometimes they're in a sufficiently calm state that their empathy can lead them to donate to charity, or <a class="postlink" href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolved-primate/201005/empathy-is-what-really-sets-vegetarians-apart-least-neurologically-speak">give</a> <a class="postlink" href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animal-emotions/201207/brain-scans-show-vegetarians-and-vegans-are-more-empathic-omnivores">up</a> meat, or vote for more humane policies.<br/><br/>I did a brief web search and didn't find a lot of studies, but "<a class="postlink" href="http://www.tru.ca/faculty/wlroberts/prosocial.pdf">Empathy, Emotional Expressiveness, and Prosocial Behavior</a>" suggested once again that people vary in the degree of connection between empathy and altruism:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Boys' empathy, in turn, was a strong predictor of prosocial behavior, R^2 = ,55. In contrast, girls' empathy was related to prosocial behaviors with friends, R^2 ~ .13, but not to cooperation with peers.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>The argument isn't about whether empathy sometimes has an effect but whether it's the most efficient point of leverage for inducing greater altruism.<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">(2) Empathy leads to long-term change</span><br/><br/>To some extent I think Brooks and I are talking about different things. Brooks portrays empathy as a fleeting feeling, "a way to experience delicious moral emotions without confronting the weaknesses in our nature that prevent us from actually acting upon them." This is not really what I'm after. Back in 2007, I had <a class="postlink" href="http://felicifia.org/old/www.felicifia.com/showDiary.do_diaryId=142">the following exchange with David Pearce</a>:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="font-weight: bold">David</span>: there are euphoriant drugs known in the scientific counterculture as"empathogens" that reliably induce compassionate well-being. The most famous empathogen is of course MDMA (Ecstasy) - the "hug drug". [...]<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Brian</span>: Thanks, David. I don't know much about empathogens, but if the major effect is to produce a feeling of "<a class="postlink" href="http://www.hedweb.com/ecstasy/index.html">I love the world and the world loves me</a>," this doesn't actually make things better. Feeling at one with other people and animals doesn't do anything to help the sick bird that's being eaten alive by predators right now. What matters is whether people are actually motivated to do something about it.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>I agree with Brooks that feel-good emotions are not sufficient for altruistic action.<br/><br/>Brooks goes on to suggest that moral principles play a bigger role in action:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>People who actually perform pro-social action don’t only feel for those who are suffering, they feel compelled to act by a sense of duty. Their lives are structured by sacred codes.<br/><br/>Think of anybody you admire. They probably have some talent for fellow-feeling, but it is overshadowed by their sense of obligation to some religious, military, social or philosophic code. They would feel a sense of shame or guilt if they didn’t live up to the code. <br/></div></blockquote><br/>I think this might be true. Even for myself, I'm more often motivated by a general feeling of "this is the right thing to do" rather than "I feel sorry for this particular suffering worm," although to be honest, for me the two feelings are pretty close to each other. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/><br/><br/>However, where do these moral principles come from in the first place? For me and probably for a decent fraction of altruists, this strong sense of duty comes from past empathy. Watching a factory-farming video, for example, can change people's lives. The compassion that we feel in a particular instance often doesn't -- and probably shouldn't -- impel short-term action, but it can redirect your life orientation for the long term. If there weren't suffering in the world, I would probably still be playing video games to pass away the days. Empathy is what gives me a purpose in life; without it, I wouldn't care about moral principles in the first place.<br/><br/>Sure, empathy is often not sufficient to provide follow-through without other personality traits (motivation, persistence, intelligence, etc.), but of course that's the case. No single emotion is going to produce effective altruism on its own; you need the combination of several of them. Brooks would probably agree with this, because he acknowledges that promoting empathy does some good; he just points out that it's not enough. That said, I think the tone of the article may lead people to feel as though promoting empathy is valueless rather than recognizing that it's just one ingredient of the recipe.<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">(3) Empathy guides moral principles</span><br/><br/>Plenty of people do have meaning in life without significant empathy. Where does it come from? Well, some examples are religious devotion and commitment to conservative moral principles (purity, loyalty, respect for authority, etc.) People can be strongly motivated to action by these things as well. But these are mostly bad moral principles. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/><br/><br/>If we instead promote empathy, we can hook up people's moral-principle brain functions with the cause of reducing suffering. This would make people more liberal, because <a class="postlink" href="http://www.moralfoundations.org/">liberal morality tends to focus mainly or even exclusively on care/harm</a>, and maybe that's part of why Brooks doesn't seem to like empathy-promotion programs.<br/><br/>In the paper that Brooks cites, Jesse Prinz notes this as well.<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>For  conservatives,  there  is  little  tolerance  for  transgression;  three  strikes  and  you’re  out.  Lakoff  captures  the  liberal  value  system  by  saying  that  for  liberals,  morality  is  empathy.  The  construct  of  empathy  is  essential.  Liberals  try  to  empathize  with  both  victims  and  transgressors,  and,  instead  of  dividing  the  world  into  good  and  evil,  they  try  to  put  themselves  in  the  shoes  of  people  on  both  sides  of  every  divide.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Prinz goes on to enumerate some dangers with purely empathy-based morality, which are similar to the concerns I raised against James Doty's statements. For example, empathy can lead people to care more about women and children vs. men, or cute animals vs. ugly ones, or those close to us vs. far away, or those affected by disasters vs. systemic problems. These are all real concerns, and this is why rationality is also essential. Indeed, maybe there would be higher leverage in studying <a class="postlink" href="http://www.caltech.edu/content/certain-types-brain-damage-can-improve-utilitarian-moral-judgments-research-shows">what kinds of brain mechanisms make people utilitarian</a> in their thinking?<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">Closing words</span><br/><br/>Promoting empathy is valuable for a decent fraction of the population, not just in terms of achieving short-term altruism but more importantly because it inspires people to care about morality in the first place and inspires them to care about the right sorts of moral principles.<br/><br/>There remains the question: Is promoting empathy the most cost-effective use of our resources? I'm skeptical that it is, and I don't intend to fund it in the near term. One reason is that lots of people care about empathy, but few care about specific issues like wild-animal suffering and sentient simulations, so we might expect more low-hanging fruit from the latter. That said, if compelling empathy interventions appear, I might pursue them, and at the very least, I think it's fascinating to keep an eye on work like what CCARE undertakes. I'm glad someone is doing it.<br/><br/>I also acknowledge that my interest in empathy may be based too much on personal experience. I'd be glad to hear from others: What are the influences that were most responsible for inspiring you toward action to reduce suffering?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Anecdote: The lettuce I buy from the supermarket sometimes has fruit flies, often dead, trapped on the leaves. This makes me pretty sad, because I can imagine the suffering these flies must have endured being trapped, and then I realize how much more suffering like this went on away from my sight when the lettuce was being grown and insecticides were being applied. Then I think further about how much suffering like this happens in nature as well (hence why insecticides aren't necessarily a bad thing if they prevent enough insects from being born).<br/><br/>My response to the sadness is to feel like I want to do something to help, but upon reflection, I realize the best things I can do to help are probably roughly what I'm already doing. In addition, this experience reinforces my motivation not to let insects take too much of a back seat in my focus. The end result is basically to reinforce my resolve as well as make sure that I stay on the right course as far as what I'm doing.<br/><br/>I guess this isn't the experience of everyone. Sometimes short-term compassion leads to short-sighted action. I think, though, that this is because many people don't have a systematic plan for compassion with their life's work. They treat compassion like a checkbox to do in a summary way and then move on. I can understand this, because this is how I treat many other aspects of life that I don't care about. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/> I guess in my case, I realized that I couldn't justify doing anything other than focusing on compassion with my life. So at least for a few people, empathy does seem to bubble into long-term vision. Again, though, I don't know if there are better points of leverage in creating effective altruists than by encouraging compassion.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">I agree, Hedonic Treader. The first paper my cognitive-science professor assigned his students to read was a study showing that people believe explanations with neuro-babble more than equally good explanations without it.<br/><br/>The thing is, we eventually do need the neuroscience. It's not bogus. It's just that, as you say, it takes a lot of work to understand the details. It's sort of like math: In the end, what we understand with mathematical tools is profoundly more insightful than without them, but it's very easy to come up with a simple or ineffective idea, bury it in mathematical jargon, and make it look impressive. Good math is hard and takes a lot of time, but it's ultimately the only way to go. Same for neuroscience.<br/><br/>This means that I don't expect the empathy research necessarily to produce groundbreaking <span style="font-style: italic">practical</span> insights only because they use more neuroscience than other psychological communities. Rather, I think they're building the theoretical foundation that will eventually allow for taking the next step beyond what we have now -- e.g., direct brain manipulations.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2">"<a class="postlink" href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/ohio-school-shooter-tj-lane-victims-families-finger/story?id=18763554#.UUzSgBzvt8E">Ohio School Shooter TJ Lane Laughs, Gives Finger at His Sentencing</a>":<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Lane was waiting for a bus to an alternative school when he killed three students during a Feb. 27, 2012 rampage at Chardon High School. Daniel Parmertor, 16, Demetrius Hewlin, 16, and Russell King Jr., 17, died in the attack. Three other students were injured.<br/><br/>Lane arrived at his sentencing hearing today wearing a blue button down shirt. After he sat down, he unbuttoned the shirt to reveal a white T-shirt with the word "killer" emblazoned across the front in black marker.<br/><br/>When Lane was given the opportunity to make a statement to the court, he gave a short, crude statement that ended with "f*** all of you" before sticking up his middle finger in the courtroom filled with the loved ones of the three students he gunned down.<br/><br/>"Frankly, I wasn't prepared for this," the prosecutor said moments after Lane's gesture. He said the action was proof that Lane is a "disgusting human being."<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>Lane smirked and smiled as family members of his victims called him "repulsive" and hoped for him to be locked up in a cage "like an animal" for the rest of his life.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Sad to see the hostility on both sides, but it's not surprising. In the days before government had a monopoly on legitimate violence, emotions of revenge served as deterrence.<br/><br/>It's also sad to see that they want him locked up "like an animal." What does that say about animals?<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>"I hope you have a cold, rough, unkind prison life with monsters like yourself," [Parmertor's mom] said. "If I had my choice you would die an extremely slow, torturous death...You're a weak, pathetic, vile coward."<br/></div></blockquote><br/><img alt=":(" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif"/><br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>"What was the motive for this merciless rampage?" the judge asked before announcing his sentence. "The answer is, we don't know. We have not been provided a clear answer or even a murky one."<br/><br/>Judge David Fuhry said Lane appeared to simply want to "make a big splash, make front page news."<br/><br/>"[He] attacked without discernible motive, provocation or reason. The court finds such a person extremely dangerous," he said.<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>"To the contrary, TJ Lane was an intelligent student positioned to graduate early. He was not insane, incompetent or impaired on Feb. 27, 2012," the judge said. "He consciously and methodically carried out a plan to kill."<br/></div></blockquote><br/><img alt=":(" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif"/></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
