<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">A subject which I though might interest the utilitarian.<br/><br/>A somewhat recent survey by Gallup polls asked adults from all around the world questions about how much positive emotion they feel, such as asking whether they smile and laugh a lot, or if they feel respected.<br/><br/> The survey indicated that Panama is the most positive country, with 85% of adults answering positively to all the questions. The average income in Panama is about $15,600 and an ecological footprint of 2.87 hectares per person. It is unsurprising to find countries struck by disaster and war near the bottom, like Haiti and Afghanistan, but the least positive country was found to be Singapore, with just 46% answering positively to all questions, while the average income there is $61,000 and 5.34 hectares per person.<br/><br/>I am not to say that money is the opposite of happiness; in fact, Canada and The Netherlands can be found near the top of the list, as well as some impoverished countries near the bottom. However, I feel that this survey suggests that money is neither positively or negative correlated with happiness, and rather, it has to do with other factors. One man reported from Singapore that there is little work-life balance. Perhaps some of this is due to the country being entirely urban?<br/><br/>Furthermore, the survey suggests that happiness can be achieved without large amounts of wealth and without having a large effect on the environment. It is probably affected by environmental factors too, like temperature, landscape, hours of sunlight, etc.<br/><br/>Just thought I would bring this up. Here is the survey if you are interested:<br/><br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/159254/latin-americans-positive-world.aspx#2">http://www.gallup.com/poll/159254/latin ... rld.aspx#2</a></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Thanks for the input.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>A quick Google search shows graphs stating that there is a correlation. It's much weaker than most people imagine, and it takes more money to make you happy than people commonly think, but it's there.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Definitely a possibility. Cantril's ladder measures more of what people think of their life in general, while the survey by Gallup asks more specific questions as I mentioned earlier. Of course, both studies are rather subjective, and there may be some deviation of how happy people actually are as opposed to how happy they say they are, as well as cultural differences on how happiness is viewed. Perhaps there is some third variable that affects both wealth and happiness?<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>...very strong unhappiness would be zero? How to interpret this? If they had asked for a number between -5 and +5, would the distribution have been the same? Does this mean almost half of the respondents believe that their lives aren't worth living, i.e. everyone who responded less than 5 on the 0 to 10 scale?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Here is the exact wording of that survey:<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">Please imagine a ladder with steps numbered from zero at the bottom to 10 at the top.<br/><br/>The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you.<br/><br/>On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time? (ladder-present)<br/><br/>On which step do you think you will stand about five years from now? (ladder-future)<br/></span><br/><br/>I think what people who answered below 5 are saying is that they are less than halfway to reaching their ideal life, rather than saying their life has negative felicific value. Also, while 0 represents the "worst possible" life, this does not necessarily imply that 0 = life not worth living. Maybe some people still found their "worst possible" life still worth living?<br/><br/>I agree that -5 to +5 would be a better alternative, while making sure to tell the participants that everything positive is worth living, everything negative is worth not living, and 0 is not worth living but would not be bad to live. Then we could take life expectancy into account:<br/><br/>75 years of pleasure is better than 60 years of equal pleasure, while 60 years of pleasure is better than 75 years of suffering.<br/><br/><br/>Here is another study by Gallup which measures people's <span style="font-style: italic">negative</span> emotions. Interestingly enough, many countries which recorded positive emotions of the previous study also reported high levels of negative emotion.<br/><br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/155045/Middle-East-Leads-World-Negative-Emotions.aspx#2">http://www.gallup.com/poll/155045/Middl ... ons.aspx#2</a></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

The UK had an average of about 7 for the 1 through 10 life satisfaction survey.<br/><br/>Now, if only we could know where the 3% who believed life not worth living ranked their life satisfaction, we would have some data from which to find "not worth living" on the life satisfaction scale. If we assume that most of those 3% put their life satisfaction below the average, and rule out (for the purposes of trying to establish a point of hedonic zero) how subjective the survey was, can we infer that in the UK the point at which life becomes not worth living is less than 7?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
