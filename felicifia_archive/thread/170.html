<h3><a href="#p1118">Reasons SIAI (and research generally) is not optimal?</a></h3>
<p class="author"><img alt="Post" height="9" src="../styles/nexus/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" title="Post" width="11"/>by <strong><a href="../user/64.html">Brian Tomasik</a></strong> on 2009-07-19T21:25:00</p>
<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Among the utilitarians I've met over the years, a sizable fraction have come to the conclusion that the optimal destination for utilitarian funding is organizations that research speculative futuristic scenarios and the philosophical / scientific / methodological questions that such research requires. In particular, many of these utilitarians have named the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_Institute_for_Artificial_Intelligence">Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence</a> (SIAI) as a good example of such an organization, so I'll focus on it here, but the discussion can apply more broadly.<br/><br/>The claim that it's optimal for utilitarians to research speculative scenarios (including unsettled methodological problems like <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/consciousness.html">understanding qualia</a> or <a class="postlink" href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/infinite.pdf">evaluating our impacts in an infinite universe</a>) derives from the observation that small changes to the quality of our understanding could drastically alter our conclusions about which courses of action are good and bad. For instance, suppose we discovered that entities we never thought conscious actually do experience qualia and, in fact, suffer greatly in a preventable way. (This isn't an absurd suggestion -- it happened to me several years ago when I realized that animals can feel pain. To the extent that the question of which animals can suffer <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/insect-pain.html">remains open</a>, such a discovery process is still going on right now.) If these entities outnumbered the sentient organisms we currently know about by orders of magnitude, the new optimal course of action could be dominated by doing what would prevent the most suffering on the part of those new entities.<br/><br/>As far as focusing on futuristic speculation, the argument is basically that there's a non-negligible chance that humans will have <a class="postlink" href="http://www.singinst.org/blog/2007/05/26/5-minute-singularity-intro/">vast impacts on their future light cone</a>, affecting many orders of magnitude more sentient organisms than have or will ever populate earth during the few billion years for which life exists there. The chance that humans do have such an astronomical impact is small, but the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/why-expected-value.html">expected value</a> is still likely enormous.<br/><br/>As a follow-up to my <a class="postlink" href="../thread/160.html">previous question</a> about where to donate, I'll note that I'm currently leaning toward donating the money toward research at SIAI. While in general that organization's work is probably something that utilitarians would endorse, this particular project is one that I've coordinated to be of special interest for utilitarians concerned about preventing massive amounts of suffering in the universe -- possibly even outside our lightcone. In general, I <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/donation-recommendation.html">recommend that utilitarians consider contacting SIAI</a> to see if the group can arrange for research that may be of mutual interest.<br/><br/>The main objection I have to this strategy is the following. I am a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.felicifia.com/diary/118/">total</a> <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarianism.com/hedutil.htm">hedonistic</a> utilitarian with an "exchange rate" between pleasure and pain that gives a significant weight to the badness of pain. In addition, I care more about animal suffering than I think most people do, in part because hedonism implies a lot more potential value and disvalue on the part of animals than do consequentialisms that value more abstract traits that seem to be possessed mainly by humans and their evolutionary kin. The number of people who hold my particular values is very small; the number who hold utilitarianism proper is somewhat bigger; and the number of <a class="postlink" href="http://lesswrong.com/">rationalists who tend to hold some brand of consequentialism</a> is larger still.<br/><br/>Now, knowledge is important, but so is ideology. For instance, I have <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/friendly-ai.html#concern2">concerns</a> about what might result from a superintelligent <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/friendly-ai.html">friendly AI</a> that -- perhaps influenced by <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_ecology">deep ecology</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.panspermia-society.com/Panspermia_Ethics.htm">impulses to propagate life</a>, or perhaps just due to giving insufficient <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-nature.html">thought to animal suffering</a> -- led to an increase in the number of wild animals throughout the universe, or perhaps <a class="postlink" href="http://utilitarian-essays.com/lab-universes.html">in new universes</a>. So there's a question: At what point is it better to promote your specific memes (hedonistic anti-speciesism, in my case) rather than general knowledge or AI that's generally "human-friendly" but perhaps not Benthamite? This might include, for instance, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-nature.html">promoting concern about wild-animal suffering</a>, so that -- if humans do have a huge impact on the future of the universe -- they do so in a positive rather than negative way. Sure, research on decision theory is important, but unless people use it to maximize the right things, it's to no benefit, and could even be harmful.<br/><br/>However, I should point out that while SIAI has no explicit ideology, several of its members do lean strongly utilitarian, and many more lean strongly toward some sort of rationalist consequentialism. So even on the question of ideology, SIAI may not be a bad choice for Benthamites, because the amount of philosophical overlap remains extremely high relative to the overlap with the general population. And if one arranges for specific research on a utilitarian-oriented project, the actual marginal impact of a utilitarian's donation can potentially be even better. But I still think contributing to SIAI's general funds is (probably, based on my current knowledge) an excellent choice.<br/><br/>What do others think here? Are there other reasons SIAI and the like are not optimal for utilitarians? For instance, perhaps the Singularity scenario is highly improbable. Or perhaps SIAI's ability to have an impact on it if it did occur would likely be minuscule. Or maybe real "friendly AI" is a utilitarian pipe dream that will almost certainly never amount to anything. While I agree with all of those statements, I still think the vast potential consequences of success here dominate the expected-value calculation.<br/><br/>But maybe there are other causes that would have higher chance of success? Or other organizations more qualified to address these matters? Or other donation strategies (e.g., funding research informally by coordinating with undergraduate students) that have higher leverage? In other words, tell me why SIAI is not an optimal recipient of charitable-donation dollars for expected-value maximizers?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<h3><a href="#p1120">Re: Reasons SIAI (and research generally) is not optimal?</a></h3>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Toby Ord would probably be the best person to speak to about this (although if he responds I hope he'll do so in public).<br/><br/>My problem with these shot-to-nothing scenarios is that the arguments inevitably involve more wild guesswork than the arguers suggest. The typical reasoning goes that some event has a massive impact on net utility, which heavily outweighs its implausibility.<br/><br/>But we seem to have increasing difficulty calculating the odds of even day-to-day events to the kind of degree that would allow such precision, and these are predictions that involve countless factors that such arguments usually gloss over. (I find this with your arguments for Pascal's wager, for eg, which is a relatively simple case in that all you need to do is show that the Christian heaven is more plausible than any other infinite utility alternative). The writer is always willing to offer reasons why he/she thinks one should believe the numbers weigh what they say they do, but they're nowhere near being a mathematical proof. So they're ultimately gut instinct.<br/><br/>More immediate projects - your warm fuzzies ones - invoke far fewer variables, and even then if you were to try to calculate the hedons involved you'd never finish. One advantage they have, I suppose, is that results (or lack of them) can be turned around relatively quickly, so you can see whether they've met goals they were aiming for. Even if the SIAI's goals happen to be sensible ones, you'll never be able to evaluate how well they're meeting them.<br/><br/>An alternative issue, which I is perhaps less significant but worth considering, is simply the public perception of the charities you might give to. The average reasonably smart person is quite capable of understanding eg Toby's comparison of Fred Hollows to Seeing Eye, and might find it particularly inspiring that someone like you were exemplifying a new kind of 21st century human, who genuinely structures large parts of his life around helping others - inspiring enough to persuade her to increase her own donations. Such inspiration is likely to be much more powerful if the causes you're supporting are ones said average person a) intuitively supports and b) can see a powerful case that they're superior to some of the alternatives one might consider. The Fred Hollows vs Seeing Eye comparison holds for both points, the SIAI vs Fred Hollows comparison holds for neither.<br/><br/>You can potentially imagine the tabloids running a sympathetic story about someone who'd cured <span style="font-style: italic">n</span> people of blindness last week. If they ran a similar story about someone who'd reduced the chance of a lab universe by a factor of <span style="font-style: italic">n</span>, you can bet it would only be to mock them. The same probably goes, albeit slightly less, for the broadsheets - they're not exactly written exclusively by utilitarianism sympathisers.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Thanks for the comments, Arepo.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>(I find this with your arguments for Pascal's wager, for eg, which is a relatively simple case in that all you need to do is show that the Christian heaven is more plausible than any other infinite utility alternative).<br/></div></blockquote><br/>I think it is the case that "all you need to do" is show that a particular possibility has sufficiently large potential consequences, not discounted by a correspondingly small probability, that a particular term dominates in the expected-value calculation. But showing that is the whole meat of the question and isn't trivial.<br/><br/>I guess you might say it's "close to impossible." Still, I try to be an <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/why-expected-value.html">expected-value maximizer</a>, so any non-infinitesimal change in probabilities here is, in my view, highly valuable.<br/><br/>Your point about public sympathy is relevant. Indeed, when making the case for, say, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/19990905.htm">living frugally in order to donate large amounts</a>, it does make sense to use tangible causes for purposes of illustration. Singer has probably made more of a positive impact on the world by taking his example charity to be Oxfam than SIAI (or even perhaps GiveWell, arguably for the same reason). Still, if your donations are private, this needn't be a problem, unless you make public claims about <span style="font-style: italic">actually</span> donating to Oxfam. And being public about donations to more speculative projects could be a good idea among utilitarians (hence this post).</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Such inspiration is likely to be much more powerful if the causes you're supporting are ones said average person a) intuitively supports and b) can see a powerful case that they're superior to some of the alternatives one might consider.

I think that we have to recognise here that much more than we can get done alone, we can get done by inducing favourable behaviour in friends, colleagues, relatives, acquaintances, and others. To counter that you may achieve a maximal impact by inducing other philnathropic utilitarians to direct their donations towards SIAI, you're just delaying the fundamental question. Does donation to SIAI marginalise utilitarianism as a politically viable choice. And in my opinion, the answer here is definitely yes. I think that disregarding absurd targets of philanthropy will hardly compromise our integrity and it will clearly favour our public relations. I suppose some sociological &amp; historical expertise might help. From what sociology I know, I would imagine we can get the most done by opposing those behaviours that have moderate prevalence at the time. For example, now that slavery is inexistent in Western Countries, we have shifted our attention to sex-based, race-based, disability-based, species-based discrimination. I fear that to promote the wellbeing of aliens is decades too far ahead of our time.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">The primary driver of humanity's immense power to create and destroy has been technology. Altering the course of it can have radical implications. A more relevant question would be what sort of technological advancement should be promoted.<br/><br/>It seems to me that Open Source modes of production are more equitable, just, and efficient. If we are to create a world free of artificial scarcity, we must collaborate. Luckily, the logic of the new communications technologies we have been inundated with inherently fosters decentralized, distributed innovation and collaboration.<br/><br/>We need wiki-science. We need Open Source biotechnology and nanotechnology. Patents in these areas are already showing themselves to have perverse consequences. The domain of life should not be patentable, it should remain in the Commons.<br/><br/>Considering it is bio and nanotechnologies which hold the potential to initiate mega-scale projects such as the elimination of wild animal suffering, we must be very concerned with their development. How is eliminating wild animal suffering profitable? It clearly is not. Only the open source mode of production can effectively mobilize people to tackle this issue, and other issues of similar scale and importance which have no profit motive to incentivize them.<br/><br/>I don't know enough to comment on AI specifically, but certainly its utility function would need to be coded to value all sentient life. There is no way to be certain of this without it being open source. However, I don't hold out any hope for the singularity since it is all over my head, and I cannot place any reasonable probability estimate upon it. It is like one big deus ex machina that many people invoke to tell people to forget about any immediate political concerns.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote><div><cite>RyanCarey wrote:</cite>I fear that to promote the wellbeing of aliens is decades too far ahead of our time.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I think that is a legitimate concern. Many people still aren't sure whether to care about, say, the chicken that went into the nuggets they're eating, so the suggestion that extraterrestrial-wild-animal suffering matters might give them fuel for a reductio against caring about animals at all.<br/><br/>Still, for someone who thinks extraterrestrial suffering is potentially orders of magnitude more important than chicken suffering, there's a risk that, if he doesn't promote the cause, no one will -- maybe society would never get to that stage of progress. In the case of SIAI, I think the main argument for action now is that we may simply not have time to wait for society to come around to thinking about these questions, because AGI might come first (possibly within a few decades).<br/><br/>EmbraceUnity, thanks for the comments. I'll defer to SIAI for answering the question of to what extent open-source AI is a good idea -- I'm not sure. As far as coding a value on sentience into the objective function of the AI, I agree with the sentiment, though I would just remark that we need to be extremely careful about how the AI determines what "happiness" and "suffering" are. We don't want an AI, wired to have a happy-face-expression detector, that turns the solar system into molecule-scale smiley-face pictures (p. 15 <a class="postlink" href="http://www.singinst.org/upload/artificial-intelligence-risk.pdf">here</a>). Working out such issues is one of the main projects that SIAI is tackling.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">I had a few more thoughts against this, not particularly related:<br/><br/>1) The kind of AI-induced catastrophe you envision seems likely to wipe out local life pretty quickly if it happens. This seems likely to be a relatively clean cut compared to more familiar disasters like meteor strikes, global warfare etc. If it wipes us out, it will probably do so with much less suffering than they would.<br/><br/>2) The same kind of catastrophe would probably (the way you describe it) eliminate all sentient life on earth, rather than just all humans, as a major war/impact/plague etc might. If you believe that wild animal suffering outweighs wild animal happiness, then this is a much preferable result to one that left the biosphere going as a misery generator.<br/><br/>3) The fact that someone is asking a question doesn't mean they're answering it. One recurring objection I have to utilitarian arguments is that where precise data isn't available they fudge - fair enough in itself - but then act <span style="font-style: italic">much </span>too confident about their probability guesstimates, often relying on (often equally haphazard) large numbers to overwhelm the difference. I would be wary of funding any such group of people until they can show some sort of substantial evidence that their analysis of the world is more accurate than, for eg, a reasonably intelligent scientist's. Otherwise they seem as likely as the rest of us to suffer cognitive biases, not least self-preservation bias if honest enquiry would lead to the conclusion that their jobs are an inefficient use of money.<br/><br/>4) This is the most interesting thought I've had, specifically aimed at Alan and others with a fair amount of money to throw around and the willingness to throw it - if there are various causes which it's very hard to differentiate between with any degree of confidence, rather than picking one somewhat arbitrarily (see 3), you could do something more deliberate:<br/><br/>a) pick out those causes that are obviously more utilitarian than many others, and not obviously less so than any (eg curing cataracts, education for third world women, promoting veganism, universal welfare organisations in general, funding research into certain technologies and more, perhaps promoting political action on extremely cut and dried issues)<br/><br/>b) try to identify the most effective organisations in terms of the effectiveness of your dollar - again with the same elimination criteria (Givewell, Population Services International, Fred Hollows, SIAI etc). Probably aim to select an equal number of organisations in each category so they're equally weighted.<br/><br/>c) put together a list of the remaining organisations.<br/><br/>d) pledge a regular donation of $N to all of the organisations on the list, initially to be distributed evenly among them.<br/><br/>e) set up a scheme where you invite people to donate to one or more of the selected groups and offer to adjust your donation according to those given by people who sign up for it. Two possible egs:<br/><br/>i) first come first serve. You'll match all other donations D up to a total of N from the $N pool, distributing N-D (if &gt;0) evenly among the list afterwards.<br/><br/>ii) proportionately. At the end of a specified time, you'll calculate how much of D has been given to each organisation, and divide N up with the same proportional distribution.<br/><br/>The obvious plus to this setup is that what you lose in slightly greater credence for the efficacy of one approach, you surely gain in giving people (both utilitarian and others) an incentive to give more - if I feel much more strongly about the risk of climate change than of short term poverty reduction, I can give pay for money to go my preferred cause at a drastically increased rate.<br/><br/>If you tried ii) there'd be the risk of richer philanthropists dominating the pool and disillusioning the poorer ones, but if that happened, you could always ask some of said philanthropists to donate their money to expanding N rather than D. i) might be a better way of winning people over though, since if they donated early enough they could almost guarantee close to doubling their contribution, whereas if it's proportional, some people might find the expected gain too nebulous to feel as motivated by.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">That's about the size of it, although I don't think I was proposing an artificial limit to the donation-matching. There's obviously a practical one in that even rich benefactors can't match more than they have, but otherwise it seems to me like the bigger N is, the more motivating it would be. <br/><br/>That said, I had a couple of further thoughts:<br/><br/>f) rather than selecting one particular way of apportioning N, you could divide it up into multiple pools. Then you could see which actually received the most contributions, and adjust the pool size/number accordingly.<br/><br/>g) As an alternative to i) and ii), I thought of the perverse sounding<br/><br/>iii) Absolute. Invest N in a relatively high interest (but probably low-risk) account, and don't donate any of it except to match contributions. If at the end of your assigned time limit any of N remains, you put in the next set of N, as you would in the other examples. But at any point, the sum of N-D is sitting somewhere gathering interest, but not going to any charity.<br/><br/>This one seems like it might have a really powerful motivating factor, especially for people who weren't confident enough of their views to make larger contributions than normal just to swing donations from one direction to another. In this case, those contributing to D know that (in a sense, at least) N is actually not going to go anywhere unless they give their money. <br/><br/>You'd obviously want to find a fine balance here so that the value of iii)N wasn't too far beyond the expected sum of iii)D. But you also wouldn't want to modify it so much that it ruined the sense that N is only going to charity if you pay for it to. <br/><br/>Anecdotally, I would find iii) extremely motivating. If someone like Alan were to set up eg ii) and i), I'd certainly give a few quid to both, but if he were to set up iii) and ii) I'd probably give a token sum to ii)D to test the waters, but I'd be keen to instantly give a large sum relative my income to iii)D.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev hidden" data-snap="0">Arepo, all of your points 1-3 from the 04 Aug 2009 are excellent; in fact, they've been concerns of mine as well. I didn't happen to mention them in the original post, but they are important to think about. Regarding #2, one response that SIAI might make is that, say, a smiley-face AI with the goal of maximizing the number of smiley faces in the universe wouldn't hesitate to engage in ruthless behavior to accomplish its objectives. It might, for instance, run lots of universe simulations (producing lots of wild-animal suffering in the process), or use reinforcement-learning algorithms in a painful way, or threaten torture to coerce other civilizations into helping it out. I agree these may be tenuous scenarios, and it seems perhaps implausible to imagine that a poorly designed, kludgey AI would actually be rational enough to succeed at such plans. But it's hard to say -- I think the ideas need further exploration.<br/><br/>That brings up point #3, which I agree is a concern. Still, even if the SIAI community isn't more capable than your average group of philosophers, it remains the case that they're doing important philosophical work, and it seems worthwhile to increase the total size of the funding pie devoted to such research.<br/><br/>The various ideas under point #4 are interesting. Indeed, I think there are major philanthropists who do something like this through their matching-grant challenges: i.e., they donate an amount to one of their preferred causes that's somehow proportional to the amount others donate. (iii) is like a 2-for-1 match (or n-for-1, for some n), though the threat that the money wouldn't otherwise be donated is more credible in the case of (iii) -- usually, I suspect the philanthropists will donate anyway what they don't use for matching.<br/><br/>My main objection to the proposal is that I don't think there's a large number of almost equally valuable charitable causes, even within the fudge factors of our ignorance. I don't claim to know that cause X is very likely better than cause Y, but if you can make an argument that X might be 10,000 times better than Y, while it's somewhat less likely that Y is 10,000 times better than X, then I'll go with X over Y. As you suggested above, it's sort of like Pascal's wager: Yes, there are religions and anti-religions -- scenarios in which doing something will save you from hell, and others in which doing that same thing will send you to hell -- but unless the scenarios seem almost exactly symmetric, I'm going to treat them differently. A 50.0001% chance of avoiding hell is much, much better than a 49.9999% chance.</div>

There are a few exceptions who I won't name for diplomatic reasons, but it's not a subject with a safeguard on letting inaccurate thinkers in or obvious merit to good thinkers. It has some kind of memetic Darwinism where ideas are obviously selected for something, but that something isn't really (as most philosophers will tell you) correspondence with any standard you can check in the real world. <br/><br/>I have a 5-odd year old philosophical logic textbook that claims as 'controversial among logicians' a problem that a statistician friend told me both answers to in seconds, before pointing out that the only reason there are two possible answers is a key part of the question is ill-defined.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I don't claim to know that cause X is very likely better than cause Y, but if you can make an argument that X might be 10,000 times better than Y, while it's somewhat less likely that Y is 10,000 times better than X, then I'll go with X over Y.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>This is hopefully false. I 'can make an argument' for any proposition - I did a philosophy degree. The argument has to be compelling. <br/><br/>Personally, since you get the get the highest expected payoffs from things with roughly even chance if you increase utility/decrease probability proportionately, I think you should aim for something in that area of probability as a rule of thumb, and only move away from it where it's very clear to.<br/><br/>Coming up with these longshots and assigning super-high numbers to them seems like a cop-out that creates an infinite amount of resource-sinks. As the magnitude of any event increase, its likelihood falls, and I've never seen any reason to believe that they do so at a disproportional enough rate that backing the crazy event seems like a good idea. If you want to find whether Pascal's button is worth taking seriously, I think you should discuss it with some competent mathematicians, not philosophers, nor your personal estimation, for reasons given above. I've yet to meet any who think it has any value. <br/><br/>Even if I thought it might, I'd much rather fund a new bunch of mathematicians who find the whole thing trivial to address the problem and show why it's trivial, rather than pay an existing group of philosophers for whom it's a gravy train to discuss the ways in which it's completely improbable.<br/><br/>In any case, if you were to set up some kind of matching scheme, there'd be nothing to stop you trying to persuade people of the value of one over the other. And you'd generally expect those capable of giving the most towards it to tend toward greater intelligence, and therefore greater ability to give to the charities you lean towards if your arguments are sound.<br/><br/>Incidentally, do you know of any similar grant-matching schemes up and running? <br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>As you suggested above, it's sort of like Pascal's wager: Yes, there are religions and anti-religions -- scenarios in which doing something will save you from hell, and others in which doing that same thing will send you to hell -- but unless the scenarios seem almost exactly symmetric, I'm going to treat them differently.

I don't think that a person believing something is an a priori reason to have greater confidence in it (it seems quite plausible to me that no-one in the history of Earth has ever believed anything that was entirely true), and I don't think belief is at all well-defined. You'd be hard pressed to find a Christian who a) claimed believed hell's suffering and heaven's pleasures were infinite, b) could show that they understood the concept of infinity well enough to know what the claim entailed, c) believed the sole criterion for entering heaven/avoiding hell is swearing allegiance to (while not necessarily considering as likely) the Christian god. And even if you do, so what? The reason for his claim won't be based on any evidence for the above except other people having believed it first.<br/><br/>Besides, when you start telling  me about probabilities remote enough (and I rate the chance of any hell at all resembling the Christian one much much smaller than 0.0001%, conditional on me being vaguely sane), it eventually seems more probable to me that I've completely misunderstood logic my entire life in any one of an infinite number of ways that would invalidate this as an issue, such as infinity/(a finite number) still being infinity in some or all cases.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="4">Alan,<br/><br/>About a year ago I made many of the exact same points as Arepo, and if I remember correctly, eventually you admitted that you could not find any reason for rejecting Islam as the proper religion, considering their high fecundity, with the exception of your inability to follow the strict doctrines. Would you still say this is a fair statement?<br/><br/>If Islam became the clear dominant religion in the world, to the point where it was no contest based on numbers, would you seriously consider voluntarily changing? If not, perhaps the issue is more emotional than anything else, despite your persistent attempts at bayesian rationality.<br/><br/>One cannot induct values. There is no way to look at the way things are and figure out the way they should be, or even what potential simulators are looking for. How do you know that atheism isn't indeed what the simulators are selecting for, considering all logic tends to point that way? If supposed simulators were selecting for Christianity, surely they could create a world much more likely to confirm it... and provide actual evidence in favor of it.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I think Peter Thiel may have done something like this with SIAI's matching challenge a few years back.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Hm, looking it up on Wikipedia it sounds as though it's long since over, and only applied to donations to SIAI. I think you could set up something much more motivationally powerful, and much longer-term, which would evidence powerful real world benefits. Instead you're pouring money one of an infinite number of Pascal's Buttons, based on no greater evidence than a hunch, when you freely admit that destroying the world in its current state might actually increase net utility. <br/><br/>Another frustrating thing about this is the immediacy of certain social and political issues that have 'real' scientists - ie people who make risky claims that could be falsified - teaming up to tell governments and philanthropists that they're a huge and immediate problem. If our society survives the knock-on effects of peak oil and climate change and, say, establishes a self-sufficient extra-terrestrial colony, you might want to look at more obscure existential risks. But right now, I place more faith (though perhaps not much) in James Lovelock's warnings of impending civilisation collapse and possible extinction than I do the arguments of non-scientists. <br/><br/>You can also bet that if civilisation just takes heavy damage and continues roughly on its present course, that heavy damage will reflect in the SIAI's resources. So there's an additional argument that efforts to prevent/ mitigate short-term catastrophe will help them in the long run.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>My claim is that the existence of people who believe something may be probabilistically entangled with the truth of that belief (by which I mean partial truth about the relevant matters -- not complete truth, which I agree is next to impossible).</div></blockquote><br/><br/>It may be, but I see no reason to believe it's so closely entangled that you can't extricate them.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>"Why would you think that Christianity and anti-Christianity plausibly balance exactly? Spend some time thinking about the distribution of evolved minds and what they might simulate, and you'll get divergence."

Presumably our simulators weren't aware at the time of programming the simulation exactly how it would unfold, or they'd have no reason to run it. <br/><br/>If you think our simulators might have believed in Christianity then, as EU says, it's a very odd flavour of it that doesn't mind creating billions of people when the majority will go to hell. Moreover, I don't have any more reason to put any trust in their beliefs than I do the local street preachers'. In fact I have good reason to reject their values - they've performed an act which is completely monstrous by my standards, and obviously irrational (as in non-optimally self-serving) by theirs. <br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>I agree that the probability is rather large that our approaches to decision making, mathematical tools, logical rules, and so on are wrong, and that this is much more likely than the existence of a hell.

If it has, who knows what conclusions we should/could draw or what weighting they might have? And let me rephrase: conditional on my logic not having broken down, I rate the probabilities of infinite hells/heavens as infinitessimal.<br/><br/>I'd also add that many Christians don't subscribe to the all-or-anti-all view of theology that you have (generally the more intelligent ones reject it in my experience), and that I might rate the probability of non-infinite hells/heavens as measurable (but sufficiently low that my expected utility for spending any time trying to believe in them is much lower than of trying to enjoy my life as it appears to be).<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I assign higher probability to the incorrectness of my decision procedures than I do to getting in a car accident tomorrow.

(although I'm not sure what 'correctness of decision' procedure actually means) I think I'm more likely to get into a car accident than that I'm wrong enough about wearing a seat belt that I increase my expected welfare by not wearing one.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

But I think they would argue that we may not have time to wait, because AGI could be developed in the next few decades. It comes down to an assessment of the differential risk of different scenarios, which I agree is tough. On the other hand, if AGI is never developed, then it's a lot less important whether humans survive, since their ability to impact the universe would be many orders of magnitude smaller than if they do develop AGI.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>Notwithstanding the fact that I'm far from convinced by the simulation argument, if we're being simulated, we're still most likely in a deterministic simulation that follows local rules of physics.

Should you then take off your seat belt, because your decision theory is more likely wrong? No, of course not -- but why not? I'm claiming the same reason applies for Pascal's wager. In particular, if your decision theory is wrong, that fact neither recommends nor discourages unbuckling your seat belt.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="4">Arepo, thanks for pointing out EU's comment.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>EmbraceUnity wrote:</cite>if I remember correctly, eventually you admitted that you could not find any reason for rejecting Islam as the proper religion, considering their high fecundity, with the exception of your inability to follow the strict doctrines. Would you still say this is a fair statement?<br/></div></blockquote><br/>For the most part, yes. In practice, the reason I don't pray five times a day or fast during Ramadan is that I'm too selfish to force myself to do so. But another reason is related to what you suggest: Our simulators may very well be atheists and so <a class="postlink" href="http://reducing-suffering.blogspot.com/2009/03/motives-for-punishment.html">might punish support for religious-type values</a>; this is especially true considering that nearly all transhumanists are atheists. On the other hand, (thankfully) few transhumanists support the idea of punishing people eternally in hell, while many religious fundamentalists do. Imagine, then, a culturally fundamentalist Christian who retains the values of his former faith through the Singularity and then, upon acquiring large computational resources, decides to put into practice the religious fantasies of his childhood. Think of how many people play <span style="font-style: italic">Left Behind</span> video games. Imagine those games enhanced such that the players were actually conscious. It's a frightening thought!<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>EmbraceUnity wrote:</cite>If Islam became the clear dominant religion in the world, to the point where it was no contest based on numbers, would you seriously consider voluntarily changing?<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Yes. More strongly: I actually think Islam is not a bad choice <span style="font-style: italic">today</span>.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>EmbraceUnity wrote:</cite>If supposed simulators were selecting for Christianity, surely they could create a world much more likely to confirm it... and provide actual evidence in favor of it.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Maybe. But lots of fundamentalists subscribe to the notion that God "will destroy the wisdom of the wise" (1 Corinthians 1:19) and save the foolish children instead. Calvin seemed to have no objections against God's saving only the few to whom he gives knowledge. The same goes for Islam: "And if We [Allah] had pleased We would certainly have given to every soul its guidance, but the word (which had gone forth) from Me was just: I will certainly fill hell with the jinn and men together." (32:13)<br/><br/>What's to keep cultural fundamentalists with access to computational resources from acting upon those values in their simulations? And can you actually imagine atheist transhumanists who would torture people for obeying religious commandments?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="4"><blockquote><div><cite>EmbraceUnity wrote:</cite>This seems very clearly a status-quo bias philosophy<br/></div></blockquote><br/>I agree, actually. The reason I originally thought about hell was the fiery imagery of Christianity and Islam, but it's not necessarily the case that, upon reflection, adopting one of those religions is the best option. Maybe there are paperclipping civilizations that will punish me for not building lots of paperclips, for instance. In fact, the purpose of <a class="postlink" href="http://reducing-suffering.blogspot.com/2009/03/motives-for-punishment.html">this post</a> was to elicit feedback on what sorts of scenarios for punishment should concern me most -- whether they have anything to do with "religion" or not. Any thoughts?<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>EmbraceUnity wrote:</cite>it seems quite presumptuous that we would be able to accurately speculate upon the motives and thought processes of potential simulators.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Perhaps, but for someone like me who greatly fears hell, what alternative do I have? Plus, it's not the case that we have no insight into our potential simulators: We know a lot about the world they created. And the fact that we have human-type minds may suggest that they themselves have similar minds. (Minds are more likely to simulate minds similar to their own than to simulate random points in mind-space, I would guess.)<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>EmbraceUnity wrote:</cite>By this logic, almost anything could be the way it is because <span style="font-style: italic">that is the way it was meant to be</span>(tm)<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Sure, but some scenarios are more likely than others. That's what Bayesian inference is all about: Starting with a reasonable Occam-abiding prior and updating based on evidence. Why is this different from any other area of research?<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>EmbraceUnity wrote:</cite>why would you speculate that any civilization would spend infinite resources on torture?<br/></div></blockquote><br/>That is a good point. That's why I think the scenarios of most concern are those with not only strange simulators but strange physics that allows for some sort of low-cost <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercomputation">hypercomputation</a> in finite time or else finite computation for an infinite time. As far as I can tell, the latter scenarios needn't contradict a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Algorithmic_probability">Solomonoff-type prior</a>, as <a class="postlink" href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/z0/the_pascals_wager_fallacy_fallacy/">Eliezer Yudkowsky has noted</a>:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>many <span style="font-style: italic">computationally simple</span> laws of physics, like the laws of Conway's Life, permit indefinitely running Turing machines to be encoded.

The fact that no one can see the afterlife needn't prevent someone who subscribes to a <a class="postlink" href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/135/timeless_decision_theory_problems_i_cant_solve/">timeless decision theory</a> from committing to such an action and then following through. And of course, there's also the possibility that people could simulate hell worlds <a class="postlink" href="http://nematoddity.livejournal.com/133711.html?page=1">for fun</a>. Just search "torture your sims" and you'll find lots of extremely disturbing expressions of human boredom....<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>EmbraceUnity wrote:</cite>I was tempted to say "I now dedicate my life to making simulations of people who I will torture eternally for having differing views than mine" .... there now you have to agree with me on everything... neeneeneeneebooboo</div></blockquote><br/>Well, that's actually not a bad strategy on your part.

Because you are asking questions that are metaphysical, and yet your senses are limited to the physical world. None of your speculations meet the test of falsifiability.

Rationality is relative to a given objective function, and I'm saying my (selfish) objective function views hell as sufficiently bad that it may indeed be worth trying to take steps to avoid it. (I say my "selfish objective function" because, in utilitarian terms, my individual suffering in hell would pale by comparison with the suffering of other organisms, in hell or otherwise.

None of your speculations meet the test of falsifiability.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>I understand a hypothesis to be falsifiable relative to another if the two can give different <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function">likelihoods</a> for observed evidence. In that case, the hypotheses we're talking about are surely falsifiable. One simple example: The hypothesis of a hell-punishing god who wants everyone to be saved but requires belief in Jesus has much lower likelihood than, say, a hell-punishing god who doesn't want everyone to be saved and requires belief in Jesus.<br/><br/>If you meant "falsifiable" in a non-Bayesian sense, then I guess we just have different views on epistemological methodology.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>EmbraceUnity wrote:</cite>The number of possible scenarios which you are overlooking is infinite, and thus there are an infinite number of "risks" from the possibility of the Flying Spaghetti Monster to Quazecotl.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Every observed phenomenon has an infinite number of hypotheses that could explain it.

You're right that the probability of your claim doesn't obviously decrease as fast as the magnitude of consequence increases -- that's the whole point of the original question, after all.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>DanielLC wrote:</cite>Even if someone doesn't tell you that they'll torture 3^^^^3 people, it doesn't mean they won't.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>The point of the original mugging was that the fact that you encounter the claim is non-zero evidence which breaks an otherwise symmetrical situation.

I doubt the difference would be big enough to overcome the expected harm caused by getting rid of money that could be donated to, say, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/donation-recommendation.html">SIAI</a>, but it's certainly possible.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="4">The problem with these infinite sums is that addition isn't cumulative. What order do we add them in? Sure it's symmetric if we do (3^^^3 - 3^^^3) + (3^^^^3 - 3^^^^3) + (3^^^^^3 - 3^^^^^3) + ..., but what if we do 3^^^3 + 3^^^^3 - 3^^^3 + 3^^^^^3 - 3^^^^3 + 3^^^^^^3 - 3^^^^^3 + ... ? It's commonly even possible to make it a specific number just by changing the order. In this case, the error would grow each time, so with the limit method of infinite sums, it just wouldn't add.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="4">So we generally agree that developing artificial intelligence and self replicating nanotechnology has a probability order of magnitude of at least 0.1. To see how important this scenario is, we need an estimate of the number of entities there may be. While of course this number would be huge if we extend out our light cone for centuries, it turns out it is still huge even in this century. With self replicating nanotechnology, we could create in a few years enough one micron thick solar cells from the asteroid belt mass to create the original Dyson sphere (orbiting independent satellites, not a solid sphere). Kurzweil says that in 2030, a personal computer (order 100 W) could be functionally equivalent to a human brain. Since the capability of computers have been doubling every 1.5 years, but the energy use has not been increasing very much, this means the energy efficiency has been doubling every 1.5 years. Kurzweil talks about reversible computing in his book "the singularity is near," where no energy is required for computing. I am skeptical of this, especially because I learned that the theoretical limit for flipping a bit is the Boltzmann constant times the temperature, or ~5E-21 joules. So if we take this limit, computers can become approximately 11 orders more efficient than they are now. This means we could support approximately 1E35 consciousnesses with the Dyson sphere. So this is about 1E25 times as many as current humans. If it turns out that insects can suffer, since they have vastly smaller brains, we could induce far more suffering if we simulated insects. But if we tried to simulate an entire world, we might have to go to the atom level, which would require far more computation power, so we would not be able to simulate nearly as many organisms.<br/>Also, if we are just limited to the energy falling on the Earth's deserts, we would lose quite a few orders. But the point is that within this century, it is quite feasible that we can create far more consciousnesses than we currently have. Even if you think this only has a 1% chance of happening, the suffering of these entities is far more important than any "earthly" concern.<br/><br/>But the next question is how much our actions now can actually affect the outcome. This depends on how rapidly the technologies will come about. From my study of self replicating nanotechnology, it is clear that we will first develop technology that can replicate itself only under controlled circumstances. This would attract widespread media attention, and then we can debate whether we wanted to develop technology that could replicate in ambient conditions. As for artificial intelligence, we have been making steady progress. But it is possible that we could come up with the right algorithm that could increase its intelligence (in a similar way as unintelligent babies do, not just changing the strength of connections between neurons, but actually growing the neurons) and if set free on the Internet, it could become super intelligent in a matter of weeks. It could write a virus to take over the spare computing power of computers on the Internet. If it is hostile, we would be in trouble...</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="4">RyanCarey, I largely agree with your criticisms of fundamentalist Christianity on factual grounds. The types of punishment I fear most tend to be <a class="postlink" href="http://reducing-suffering.blogspot.com/2009/03/motives-for-punishment.html">more unusual</a>. Still, I do think "Left Behind"-video-game-style simulations by religious fundamentalists aren't inconceivable either....<br/><br/>Recumbent, I largely agree with your claim that "the suffering of these entities is far more important than any 'earthly' concern," although I do think 1% may be too high a probability to assign to your scenario. But yes, that basic "<a class="postlink" href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html">Astronomical Waste</a>"-type point is a convincing one. A caveat would apply if, as is possible though I think currently unlikely, I decide that I actually don't care about computer simulations of insects but only about "real, physical" insects. This would seem rather arbitrary, but <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/consciousness.html">so is the entire question of what computations we care about</a>.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2">Forgive my perhaps annoying habit of resurrecting old threads, but I've just read through this one and made a note of some points that I wanted to make:<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>However, I should point out that while SIAI has no explicit ideology, several of its members do lean strongly utilitarian, and many more lean strongly toward some sort of rationalist consequentialism. </div></blockquote><br/>I heard Yudkowsky give a talk in which he mocked the idea of SIAI working towards happiness-maximising AIs. The only person I know well who's involved with SIAI is Ben Hoskin and he's not too keen on utilitarianism. Carl Shulman, you're on this forum - what's your credence in utilitarianism? What would you guess the credence in utilitarianism is generally amongst the SIAI crew?<br/><br/>R.e. the choice between supporting x-risk research vs. meme propagation of concern for wild animal suffering, it's worth noting that the former promotes the latter to some extent (since the longer humans survive, the more morally intelligent they seem to become), but not vice versa.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>What about Pascal's mugging?<br/><br/>What about it? It's one of the examples I had in mind. As the utility the mugger offers increases, my credence that he'll provide it goes down (generally faster. I think the chance of him providing me with twice the GDP of earth - say $150 trillion - is less than ((the probability of him providing me $10)/ 15 trillion). Similarly, I don't see the fact that that he claims something as being evidence of its truth, ceteris paribus.</div></blockquote><br/>I don't think that your credence should go down proportionally or faster as the utility offered increases. The unlikeliness stems from the mugger giving Pascal any utility at all, not how much he is going to give him. Thus, it is extremely unlikely that the mugger will come back and magically give Pascal one utilon the following day. But surely it's not 10 times as unlikely that he'll come back and give Pascal ten utilons the following day?<br/><br/>You <span style="font-style: italic">might</span> get out of Pascal's Mugging by arguing that the mugger's claiming something provides absolutely no evidence of the claim's truth, because it's 100% obvious that the reason the mugger is making this claim has nothing to do with truth and is just to convince Pascal to give him his money. But bear in mind that you can't apply this to x-risk scenarios. The universe doesn't know you're Pascal; the evidence for these futuristic scenarios is actual evidence, not a claim borne out of someone trying to trick you.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2"><blockquote><div><cite>LadyMorgana wrote:</cite>Forgive my perhaps annoying habit of resurrecting old threads, </div></blockquote><br/><br/>No crime here. By the way, forgot to answer your question about attributed quoting in the other thread - in the initial code for the quote (the word 'quote') in square brackets, interrupt the e and the closing bracket with ="personname" - or if you only want to do it once, just click the 'quote' link, and you'll see the code at the top anyway.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I don't think that your credence should go down proportionally or faster as the utility offered increases. The unlikeliness stems from the mugger giving Pascal any utility at all, not how much he is going to give him.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I disagree with a couple of things here. One is that what you describe is either exclusively or overwhelmingly a source of unlikeliness. The other is that you believe what you say you do <img alt=":P" src="../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif"/><br/><br/>On the first, forget utilons, let's assume he's just offering money. And ditch the word 'mugger', since it begs the question, suggesting someone with nefarious intentions. It's not hard to imagine that someone could sincerely say to you 'I really need Â£10 today. If you can provide it, I'll give you Â£20 tomorrow' - banks operate on the principle that people do just this all the time, as do we when we lend money to friends. <br/><br/>So if someone with the same sort or mannerisms as a person you'd trust in that situation raised the stakes, either you would believe them to the same degree as you would the more modest person, or there's some other factor affecting your credence. <br/><br/>On the second, we've got quite a lot of evidence that neither you nor anyone else who claims to accept the reasoning of Pascal's Mugging actually does so. To wit, I've made the offer to a few such people (and in fact I'm prepared to extend it to almost anyone who claims to) that in exchange for N money today, where N is all the money they own, I'll give them say 10N tomorrow, honest to goodness. On a case by case basis, if they think that doesn't give them favourable enough odds, I might raise the amount I return by several orders of magnitude.<br/><br/>This argument doesn't really help you:<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>You <span style="font-style: italic">might</span> get out of Pascal's Mugging by arguing that the mugger's claiming something provides absolutely no evidence of the claim's truth, because it's 100% obvious that the reason the mugger is making this claim has nothing to do with truth and is just to convince Pascal to give him his money. </div></blockquote><br/><br/>- partly because my word surely has <span style="font-style: italic">some</span> evidential weight (you can imagine some claims which, if I made them, you'd consequently think were more likely to be true), and partly because even if you think it doesn't, a priori, we can test it with a lesser amount - say you give me a penny today and I'll give you 10 tomorrow. Then you have direct evidence that my word correlates with my actions, and that I'm likely to see a deal of this form through. It doesn't matter if you think it's weak evidence - so long as you don't believe in the equally diminishing probability argument, there must be some amount of money I could offer you tomorrow that would make it worth your while.<br/><br/>I don't think anyone who fails to take me up on this offer can consistently claim to believe Pascal's Mugging holds on the arguments I've seen them advance for it so far.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Losing all my possessions with 99% probability would destroy much more utility for me personally than gaining 100x or even 10000x the money value of my possessions with 1% probability.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the higher your N, the more unlikely that you can pay up and intend to pay up, considering the money has to come from somewhere in the real world, and if you had it you wouldn't need my 1/N. This is different from the metaphysical aspect of Pascal's "mugger", who might just be able to provide any amount of utility out of thin air, because he's from the 7th dimension.<br/><br/>In that case, however, the motivations of such a being become so unpredictable that you can't assign more probability to gaining the promised utility than to losing that much utility in addition to your wallet (e.g. the "mugger" could torture anyone who accepts his offer, as a wicked form of 7th dimension entertainment). The best response to the traditional Pascal's wager, imo, is that if there is a God who allows exactly this universe to exist, then His motives are so obscure and bizarre that I expect Him to send all Christians to hell and non-Christians to heaven with exactly the same - and very small - probability that He will send all non-Christians to hell and all Christians to heaven. Similar logic seems to apply to all permutations of such outlandish metaphysical claims, at least as far as I can see.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2"><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>Sure, but I can promise you enough extra money to compensate for this</div></blockquote><br/>I don't think you can, because as I've pointed out before, my probability estimate of your honesty and ability to keep your end of the bargain decreases exponentially with a linear increase of the compensation factor. The higher your N, the less realistic your motivation and ability to pay. The only way out would be additional prior knowledge. For instance, you could show me a specific and potentially successful plan to build super-intelligent FAI using an initial investment - or you could be loaded like Bill Gates, and have a history of doing such deals for the lulz.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>(also note that, as a utilitarian, you're presumably not only concerned with the utility of your money to you, in which case, at least up to a point, it might actually scale faster upwards than it does downwards - losing all of your money in a welfare state isn't a disaster, whereas having enough to pay off all the low-hanging fruit Giving What We Can have found generates a *huge* benefit).</div></blockquote><br/>Okay, but only assuming you don't extract an equal amount of utility by providing the money from the social context. For instance, if I think you're a utilitarian yourself, I might wonder why you don't just donate. If you're not, I might wonder what methods you use to get the money, and if they cause more harm than the donation is worth. And of course, we all do have an intuitive self-bias; I haven't donated myself into financial ruin so far, and I don't think I will in the future.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I don't see any reason to be interested in a Pascal's Mugger whose existence is so far outside the laws of physics that it's fantasy.

You can't plausibly offer to have access to unlimited resources, or unlimited utility generation methods. A denizen from the 7th dimension could. That's why Pascal's Mugging would be a real problem if you assigned a non-zero probability to that entity being both honest/predictable and from the 7th dimension (unlimited utility access). In this case, all they would have to do is promise a large enough amount of utility to offset the small probability. The only logical defense for unbounded expected value maximizers is the entity's unpredictability, imho. It might create disutility where it promised utility.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2">'A denizen from the 7th dimension' is just a pat way of saying 'a fantasy figure not subject to the laws of the universe'.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2">Interesting discussion of Pascal's mugging - I hadn't heard of it. Am I right in thinking it requires the premises that the muggerâ€™s claiming X (e.g. that heâ€™ll create and torture 3^^^3 people unless you give him $5) makes it more likely that X is true, and that Xâ€™s probability (given this claim) decreases slower than the payoff it involves? People above have given reasons to doubt both premises, particularly the first.<br/><br/>Here's a partly formed response I'd add. It's clearly very hard to judge the probability of scenarios like X, partly because our past experience doesn't help us decide between 'infinitesimal' and 'tiny'. Given that, Iâ€™ve no reason to think that the expected utility of giving into the mugging is positive rather than negative. One reason for this is that my judgement of this expected utility switches from positive to negative depending on various questions I really have no idea about. Another is that if I start factoring in far out possibilities like X Iâ€™d have to factor in other far out possibilities (including that the mugger will do the opposite of what he says) and I have no idea how to do so.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="3"><blockquote><div><cite>LadyMorgana wrote:</cite>R.e. the choice between supporting x-risk research vs. meme propagation of concern for wild animal suffering, it's worth noting that the former promotes the latter to some extent (since the longer humans survive, the more morally intelligent they seem to become), but not vice versa.</div></blockquote><br/>Interestingly, I have been thinking it's exactly the other way around, but more generally with concern for suffering promoting x-risk prevention, but not vice versa.<br/><br/>Arguments for concern for suffering =&gt; x-risk reduction:<br/>1) A world in which people care about reducing suffering might be a politically more stable world, because suffering often leads to some kind of conflict. I think it's relatively clear that a politically unstable world would be more prone to x-risks.<br/>2) Concern for suffering would increase the probability that a superintelligent AI singleton cares about suffering, too. But the conclusion of that is everything but clear. It might reduce x-risks. Or the AI might wipe out humanity, but replace them with some kind of superior sentient being. Or it might go on a destructive negative utilitarian rampage and wipe out all life in its future lightcone.<br/><br/>Arguments for not(x-risk reduction =&gt; Concern for suffering):<br/>3) I am rather unsure about whether survival really increases moral standards or not. After all, we still can end up in a very dystopian future that is darker than the darkest passages of medieval times. What if moral standards mostly depend on available energy and wealth? Then our moral standards might decline after peak oil.<br/><blockquote><div><cite>LadyMorgana wrote:</cite>the longer humans survive, the more morally intelligent they seem to become</div></blockquote><br/>What is that claim based on? And what do you mean exactly? The age of a single human or the age of mankind?<br/>4) A reduction of x-risks could just be the result of increased rationality and not increased moral intelligence. In that case, we would need to know whether increased rationality implies more utilitarian (say, as opposed to other consequentialist) ethical reasoning. I hope and guess that is the case, but I am also quite skeptical at the same time.<br/><br/>Concern for wild animal suffering might be a special separate case. There's the possibility that concern for wild animal suffering increases x-risks if it leads us to applying extreme measures like destroying the biosphere (by intentional venusforming of Earth for example).<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Gedusa wrote:</cite>Hmm, I'm not so sure.

It could be argued that the first level is rather low (perhaps comparable to the status quo, as it was sufficient for our survival thus far) and might even have negative expected utility, while the other one is quite high. If you optimize for survival you might end up with a higher probability of a lower average standard of morality than if you optimize for higher moral standards directly (which would be pretty relevant at least from an average utilitarian point of view).<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>LadyMorgana wrote:</cite>So it's also fair to say that it's only if humans survive that many of the benefits to wild animals rear themselves (including, not just cosmic rescue missions, but large numbers of biotechnologically-enhanced animals that can only experience happiness).

In a low morality setting mankind might cause much more (wild) animal suffering (e.g. by panspermia or simulations with sentient animals). It is very hard to make estimates about the expectation values of focusing on anti-wild-animal-suffering vs. x-risk prevention. That's why I'm uncertain about which path to follow, but I am currently much in favor or raising moral standards.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

This assumes, as you point out, that morality causally influences x-risks. I think it does, but this effect is weak. I think reductions in x-risks can be done most efficiently by improving rationality and by specific interventions (e.g. making sure there aren't asteroids headed for us). Most people don't really want extinction, at least not within the lifetimes of them or their children, so we would expect that if they were more rational, they would be likely to take steps to avoid it, regardless of increased moral feelings on the subject.<br/><br/>Oh and @ <span style="font-style: italic">"comparable to the status quo, as it was sufficient for our survival thus far"</span>; <a class="postlink" href="http://www.anthropic-principle.com/book/book.html">observer selection effects</a> seem plausible: we must find ourselves in a world where we didn't go extinct, regardless of the probability of such a world existing.

I think you've made a large jump from "average guy" to "morally enlightened" guy who cares about wild animals. The most common reason I've come across for people thinking extinction is a good thing is misanthropy followed by some form of environmentalism. I'm not sure about your categorization of long-term utilitarians either - whilst most I've met generally come to the view that they shouldn't be trying to promote extinction, a lot of us seem to be bet hedgers - saying that we should try and make more people moral in case we do survive, but that a whole bunch of suffering (both current and expected) will be prevented if we don't .<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Is it really worth the effort of taking people through the utilitarian process only for them to end up in roughly the same position on the issue that they started with</div></blockquote><br/>Yes. If they're utilitarians or some form of maximizing consequentialist, then they're more likely to make greater efforts in whatever domain they think is right.<br/>Think of how much the average guy on the street does to prevent extinction.<br/>Now think of what the average utilitarian does.<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>There's the possibility that concern for wild animal suffering increases x-risks if it leads us to applying extreme measures</div></blockquote><br/>Ohh wow. I'd never thought of that. Hmmm. It's an unlikely scenario - but if I were to quantify it, I'd say that it seemed like a good bet to make: it increases the risk of "good" x-risks (where the biosphere goes down) and decreases the risk of "bad" x-risks (where the biosphere continues). It also might be worth the risk because a galaxy spanning civilization that didn't care about animal suffering would probably be very bad.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

If you want to reduce existential risk, and if you convince 10 people to take action on the grounds of normal moral intuitions versus getting 1 person to do the same action on grounds of utilitarianism, then the former may be the better option. However, I agree with Gedusa that spreading the right framework for thinking about these questions is extremely valuable, because the future's landscape for moral decisions will look radically different from how it does today in ways that no one has thought of.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
