<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Is anyone familiar with <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happiness_economics#Criticism_of_Happiness_Economics">this subject</a>? I went to a really interesting seminar on it last year, although my libertarian (but mostly consequentialist) friend who also went was a bit scornful of what he saw as leftwing economists looking for a way to counter the apparent success of GDP-based policies.<br/><br/>That seems unconvincing to me so far - the basic criticism seems to be that it's hard to measure happiness, which isn't an argument for giving up the effort to do so and arbitrarily assigning merit to something that we can measure more easily. Also, from reading that Wikipedia piece, there are some (a fewer proportion, perhaps? - it's not clear) libertarian happiness economists.<br/><br/>In any case, there are several interesting links from that piece - maybe worth making individual threads on if anyone finds them particularly interesting?<br/><br/>I particularly liked the study on <a class="postlink" href="http://www.iadb.org/idbdocs/1776308.pdf">quality of life in the Americas (PDF)</a>.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">I believe it's done by surveys that usually use the 7-point scale, whatever it's called. If the same survey was used worldwide and from year to year, I don't think bias would be a huge issue, since the issue is relative happiness.<br/><br/>Calling the problems of measuring GDP small seems hopelessly optimistic to me. It completely ignores externalities - the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide#History">thalidomide</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos#History_of_health_concerns_and_regulation">asbestos</a> sagas wouldn't have registered as a blip, for eg. <br/><br/>It also ignores the idea of sustainability - by GDP accounts we keep getting better until we crash (either financially as last year, or more seriously when we deplete key resources (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/111704_end_oil.shtml">peak oil</a> being the most worrying eg) or when <a class="postlink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/climatechange/4976275/Amazon-rainforest-at-risk-of--ecological-catastrophe.html">feedback effects</a> from <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrate_Gun_Hypothesis">climate</a> [url]change[/url] make the planet incapable of supporting existing industries.<br/><br/>Happiness economics also has this problem to some degree, but unlike GDP, happiness isn't required to rise every year as a measure of success, so it doesn't become a self-defeating benchmark if you extend it into the future.<br/><br/>Lastly, using GDP as a benchmark fails to account for a) the <a class="postlink" href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/moneymag_archive/2006/08/01/8382225/index.htm">diminishing utility returns</a> on higher incomes (I have a better, albeit unpublished, account by Avner Offer if you want me to email it) or b) the possibility of inequality decreasing happiness (source for in the same Offer piece, source against <a class="postlink" href="http://www.econ.ed.ac.uk/papers/ineq-survey.pdf">here</a> - though I haven't read the latter yet).<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>DanielLC wrote:</cite>True, but with GDP, you can at least be fairly certain which of two countries produced more, and you have a pretty good idea of how a country's production is changing.
