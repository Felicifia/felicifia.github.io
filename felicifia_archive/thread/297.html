<p class="author"><img alt="Post" height="9" src="../styles/nexus/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" title="Post" width="11"/>by <strong><a href="../user/286.html">Ubuntu</a></strong> on 2010-09-07T01:43:00</p>
<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">I believe that many people misunderstand what empathy really is. I would argue that empathy is an emotional response to the (perceived) emotions of other sentient beings. I believe that empathy is a form of love and to empathize with someone is to identify with their emotional state of mind (ie. you are happy because they are happy, and sad because they are sad). Imagination is the basis of empathy since we cannot literally feel what other people feel. If empathizing with someone means that you identify with their emotional state of mind then you have a vested interest in whoever you empathize with feeling happy and not feeling sad. Basing ethical decisions on empathy <span style="font-style: italic">alone </span> would naturally lead to hedonism : the idea that happiness is the *only* intrinsic good and suffering is the *only* intrinsic bad, since, if we based our decisions on empathy alone, our only concern would be how other people <span style="font-style: italic">felt</span>.<br/><br/>Although we intuitively feel that we desire things other than pleasure, this is an illusion, since pleasure is actually the satisfaction of desire. We're hardwired to associate the objects of our emotions with our emotions but it's pleasure/stress that we value/disvalue, not the things that cause pleasure/stress. If we adopted an ethics of empathy/hedonism, we could only regard an action as morally right if it minimized/prevented stress or increased happiness, wrong if it caused stress or frustrated someone's desire to be happy and neutral if it did neither. This has some uncomfortable conclusions for most people (for example, an empathy oriented/hedonist world view would justify infidelity or lying if neither had any negative consequences) but I haven't yet heard a good argument against hedonism or for the idea that things other than suffering/happiness actually matter.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I think pleasure leads something to become a desire. It's entirely possible for me to desire that there's an invisible dragon in my garage, but I wouldn't feel pleasure if there was, because I wouldn't know.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>No, but the *idea* of there being a dragon in your garage causes you pleasure.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div> Also, I won't desire something if I haven't done it yet, whether or not it gives me pleasure. I likely won't desire a new food that tastes good until I taste it.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I don't really understand this. You can desire to try a new food because you expect that it might taste good. <br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Also, I suspect some of the problem is that there are things that are pleasure that we believe to be pain. I realized that once when I noticed I was looking forward to crying.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>The fact that people can have mixed emotions or positive attitudes towards negative states (and vice versa) doesn't negate what I'm saying. For example, if there was a virtual reality machine that could simulate pleasurable experiences, most people would not want to spend the rest of their lives in this machine. This would seem to discount the idea that pleasure is all we value but I only have to point out that they would avoid plugging into this machine because the *idea* of living a lie is distressing, even if they know they won't know it is a lie or feel distressed once they have been plugged in. The idea of knowing the truth is gratifying even if actually knowing the truth is not.<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>If you base your morality on empathy, wouldn't that bias it towards people you know?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Just because we have the strongest empathetic response to friends, family members and people we regard as in-group members doesn't mean that we feel nothing for 'others'. Most people feel some empathy for strangers, non-human animals, humans from other ethnic groups etc. even if nowhere near as much as they do for friends, humans, members of their social groups etc. To identify with the emotions of beings who are very different from you requires strong character, it's easy to empathize with people who are like you or who you have you strong personal attachments to. I don't feel empathy for most human beings, it's difficult for me to care about people who are rude, uncaring and inconsiderate and that's a weakness on my part but I'm still convinced that empathy should be basis of ethical decisions. People can learn to have empathy for all sentient beings and not just some, through effort, practice and imagination. In fact, studies show that compassion meditation and reading fiction regularly can increase empathy.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I usually avoid using 'sympathy' unless it's 'sympathetic happiness/stress' because it has condescending undertones (like 'pity'), even though it shouldn't since it just means 'with feeling'.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I'd rather say that although we desire things other than pleasure, these desires are not morally important.

If people believe that they genuinely desire things other than pleasure, then you're deciding on their behalf that pleasure is better for them even if they'd rather have other things. It's also condescending to tell someone what they 'really' want but if they come to see the logic in motivational hedonism then they'll see why ethical decisions should be geared towards emotional well-being. Regardless of ethics, I just do not believe that external desires exist and sentient beings actually want or don't want the objects of their emotions rather than the emotions themselves. Like I said in another thread, value is subjective so I don't see how someone can subjectively value something that they aren't subjectively aware of.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Some people do not feel empathy but some people do not think critically either. If someone doesn't feel empathy for others or posses the capacity to reason then there is no argument you can make to convince someone to behave ethically, whatever you consider to be ethical.<br/><br/>I thought ethics was the branch of philosophy that deals with how people should treat others. How can your code of ethics be based on your own happiness? I believe, all other factors considered, that empathetic people are happier since empathy is a form of love and love is a pleasurable emotion. Empathy is not 'selfless' but it isn't 'single-minded' either.<br/><br/>I believe that empathy leads to hedonism but that doesn't necessarily mean an ethical hedonist must feel empathy for others. (S)he could avoid harming others or doing what they can to minimize suffering as a matter of principle and not emotion. Even if they don't actually feel empathy, they are still behaving similarly to how an empathetic person would behave.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">^^^Decisions are not based on logic, they are based on emotional desires and *guided* by logic. Jumping off of a tall building is only illogical because it would frustrate your desire to be happy (which requires being alive). If you had no desire to be happy, it wouldn't be logical or illogical. There is no rational argument as to why people should behave ethically, you have to appeal to a person's emotional desires and aversions before you can present a logical analysis as to why any lifestyle is 'good' or 'bad'.<br/><br/>Ethics is a matter of how you treat other people so I don't see how improving your own happiness can be the basis of your ethical philosophy (unless you're making a social contract argument). Taking a walk might make you happy but it's ethically neutral. Killing someone might make you happy but it's ethically bad. I believe that empathy, as a form of love, increases a person's emotional well being more than anything else, so if you want to be happy, you should try to be empathetic. I'm not one to talk since I tried and failed miserably.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Epicurean? Utilitarian?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>The hedonism of Jeremy Bentham and the hedonism of Epicurus posit the same basic idea : that happiness is the only intrinsic good and stress is the only intrinsic bad. This is the 'hedonism' I'm talking about. (edit : did the ancient Greeks advocate egoist hedonism making Bentham the first to promote the idea of aggregate hedonism?)<br/><br/>This is my basic argument : empathy is an emotional identification with the feelings of others, to empathize with someone is to share their emotions. Ethical hedonism  is the idea that an action is only ethical if it minimizes stress/increases happiness. If you empathized with someone, you would want them to be happy and you wouldn't want them to be sad, this leads to ethical hedonism (although not necessarily psychological hedonism - the view that pleasure/stress are the only things that sentient beings actually do value/dis-value or pursue/avoid, regardless of whether or not they should). An ethics of empathy and ethical hedonism (altruistic hedonism, not egoist hedonism) aren't two separate schools of thought, they are one and the same. <br/><br/>Character is an ethical issue, you're right (since being an empathetic person is why you care whether or not other people are happy or sad to begin with), but I'm talking about what makes an <span style="font-style: italic">action</span> ethical.  I don't think it makes sense for people to place virtue ethics in contrast with deontology and consequentialism. D and C deal with decision making and either are compatible with VE.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">^^ And this is why people don't see the connection between the two. 'Hedonism' has undeserved, egoistic connotations.<br/><br/>Hedonism is a theory of value, it states that happiness is the only thing that is intrinsically beneficial and that stress is the only thing that is intrinsically harmful. Hedonism doesn't state that you should or should not harm others or that you should or should not care about your interests alone, it only defines 'harm', 'benefit' and 'interests'.<br/><br/>Empathy is an emotional identification with the (perceived) feelings of other beings. In order to justify an ethics of empathy, you have to resort to ontological hedonism. Making ethical decisions based on empathy alone can only be justified if feelings alone are intrinsically good or bad.<br/><br/>A consistent hedonist has to regard happiness/suffering as equally valuable and dis-valuable regardless of which nervous system it takes place in, at least in terms of quality. If you had access to the feelings of others, you would realize this. Empathy gives us such access. Since the ego is an illusion, we have to regard emotional experiences themselves to be good or bad period, not just good or bad for the specific 'minds' that experience them since the 'mind' is an illusion.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
