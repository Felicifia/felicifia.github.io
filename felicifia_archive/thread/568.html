<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Hanson's vision of the future has never made much sense to me. Besides being disconnected, so far as I can tell, from any kind of theory with predictive power, it relies on an archaic conception of personal identity, that thinks that even in an upload society there'll be clear distinctions between one individual and the next. Such a conception seems contrary to both recent phil of mind (eg Parfit's Reasons and Persons)) and cogsci (can't think of a reference at the moment - I think there's a good Less Wrong post about it, which is being frustratingly elusive atm).<br/><br/>I also don’t buy the idea that not committing suicide demonstrates positive utility. (The expectation of) positive utility is just one of various tools our genes use to keep us in line, whereas if we commit suicide it means that *all* their tools have failed. In other words, we’re heavily biased against doing so for evolutionary reasons.<br/><br/>For that reason, I tend to lean heavily towards QALY purchases that buy healthier life, rather than more life-years, since my understanding of QALY interviews is that they do treat ‘willingness to die’ as the sign of negative utility, and thus (IMO) are likely overrate life-saving interventions &amp; underrate life-improving ones.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the neglected tropical diseases that SCI treat are largely non-fatal, so buying QALYs through them seems likely to be a good utility purchase. I don’t know enough about the types of malaria AMF treats to have a sense of whether they would have the same advantage. Anyone have any insight/further knowledge?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote><div><cite>CarlShulman wrote:</cite>It's a reasonable assumption that people would not want to die.</div></blockquote><br/>Even assuming that this is both true and rational on their part, the healthy life-years metric seems lacking. It seems entirely possible to me that a given objectively healthy life-year is perceived as having half or double the hedonistic value of another objectively healthy life-year. It also seems quite plausible that some of the parameters affecting this depend on limited resources like space, energy, clean water etc. Other parameters may be less tangible, and some of these parameters may correlate with the objective health measure, but it still seems underspecified. The assumption that it is utility-maximizing to add as many healthy human life-years to the planet as possible appears implausible to me.<br/><br/>As for poor folk still smile, I know it's a metaphor, but it's not a particularly powerful one, given that smiling people can be generally miserable. It specifically tells me nothing about the stochastical distribution of suffering in the worst cases of illness, violence or social disconnection, including for children who die before they can ever be interviewed, and how to weigh these factors against the average quality of life of others in the respective socioeconomic demographic (assuming it is positive at all). Without any additional data, I would not be keen on experiencing the total set of experiences contained in these lives myself.<br/><br/>By the way Carl, we sometimes have discussions about whether we should be <a class="postlink" href="../thread/561.html">optimistic or pessimistic about the future</a>, including some <a class="postlink" href="../thread/537.html">potential dystopic scenarios</a>. It was <a class="postlink" href="../thread/555.html#p4767">mentioned</a> that you suspect even Negative Utilitarians should be in favor of human survival. Given the large potential increase in total consciousness and therefore potential involuntary suffering unlocked by space-colonization, we were unclear on the reasoning. Could you give a quick comment on your current estimate on this (maybe in one of the associated threads)?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Hedonic Trader, with regard to SCI, I understand that for every $3 given, not only is one year of healthy life saved, also a child will go to school for an additional year (although this stat does not count the potential cost of additional teachers). Now female education is, as far as I can gather, the factor that most reliably decreases fertility rates. So, contrary to immediate appearances, SCI should improve access to limited resources. If you find that the population issue really is a sticking point for you, you can always look in the direction of a charity like PSI, whose pi graph here shows that &gt;50% of its expenditure goes to the distribution of contraceptives.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
