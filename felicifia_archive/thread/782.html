<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">I know most who raise this topic are dismissed as silly or confused but I'd like ask what implications follow if you assign a nonzero probability to the existence of plant sentience? Even if it's extraordinarily unlikely - let's say one in a trillion odds - that plants feel pain, I'd think the expected value of their pain would be substantial due to their prevalence. You would have to know the "location" (for lack of a better word) of the subjective experience in order to do an expected value calculation (e.g., does each root feel pain? each leaf? or just the whole plant?) I know the usual criticisms of the notion of plant sentience (no known mechanisms could produce it; what evolved function would it serve?, etc) but I don't think we know enough about sentience or consciousness to say that it is impossible for any entity to have such subjective experiences (i.e., you have to assign a nonzero possibility). <br/><br/>Does a nonzero probability of plant sentience change the debate on whether there is a predominance of suffering in nature? Or what diets are most justifiable? Or even whether the continuation of the human species is justifiable?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I'm highly skeptical, but without knowing which forms of life are sentient, we'll never be able to maximize or even know how to maximize well-being. For example, several have argued compellingly (Oscar Horta, Brian Tomasik) that there is net suffering in nature. Robert Wiblin actually argues that destroying nature might be the most practical solution (<a class="postlink" href="http://robertwiblin.com/2010/01/21/just-destroy-nature/">http://robertwiblin.com/2010/01/21/just-destroy-nature/</a>)<br/>Yet, if plants can feel pain and if they on average have net positive lives, that changes all our thoughts about the utility of nature. Because plants are so numerous, if they have net positive existences in any meaningful psychological sense, it could be that more positive affect exists in nature than anywhere else. So we have two diametrically opposed implications depending on whether insects, plants, neither, or both are sentient (destroy nature vs. promote it everywhere). Without any way of knowing which forms of life are sentient, I don't see how we can ever know how to maximize utility, and it's not clear to me that we can ever have more than "educated guesses" about which forms of life are sentient.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">If Strawsonian physicalism (cf. <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism#Strawsonian_physicalism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalis ... hysicalism</a> ) is true, then fields of micro-experience may be ontologically fundamental. But this doesn't mean we need to start worrying about the subjective well-being of sticks, stones or plants. This is because such composite entities are mere structured aggregates - not unitary subjects of experience . (cf.  <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mereological_nihilism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mereological_nihilism</a> )<br/><br/>What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the generation of a unitary subject of experience? In short, we don't know. No one really understands how the brain solves the binding problem. (cf. <a class="postlink" href="http://lafollejournee02.com/texts/body_and_health/Neurology/Binding.pdf">http://lafollejournee02.com/texts/body_ ... inding.pdf</a> )<br/>Why aren't 80 billion odd (apparently) discrete, membrane-bound classical nerve cells just interconnected patterns of "mind dust"? My own idiosyncratic conjecture combines Strawsonian physicalism with macroscopic quantum coherence, but on quantum mind sceptic's  Max Tegmark's sub-picosecond decoherence timescales rather than Stuart Hameroff's milliseconds. True or false, the challenge of unifying  membrane-bound nerve cells into bound phenomenal objects or a unitary subject of experience pales into triviality compared to the challenge of unifying cellulose-encased plant cells. For a plant mind hypothesis to work, we'd need to abandon reductive physicalism in favour of a pre-scientific animism. Recall too that we do know precisely how to switch off phenomenal pain altogether in humans, namely induce nonsense mutations of the SCN9A gene. <br/> ( <a class="postlink" href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7121/abs/nature05413.html">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v4 ... 05413.html</a> )<br/>Plants lack a SCN9A gene - or any homologous (or indeed analogous) gene. So I think herbivores can eat cabbages and lettuces with a clear conscience!<br/><br/>From my experience, the "problem" of plant pain arises only because meat eaters seeking to rationalise their habit cast around for some sort of "We're-all-guilty-so-none-of-us-are" excuse and start feigning compassion for vegetables.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Good question, LJM1979! Coincidentally, I was thinking about this just a few days ago.<br/><br/>I haven't researched the number of plants in the world, though I would guess it's at least a few orders of magnitude more than the number of animals, especially if you count phytoplankton.<br/><br/>Hedonic Treader described well the case one might make for plant pain: "functional plant movement in response to integrity damage, and corresponding movement-controlling information processing of some sort." This seems like a far cry from consciousness, but given how little we know about these things, the probability is, as Hedonic Treader said, much bigger than 1 in a trillion.<br/><br/>Still, the probability is a lot lower than for insects. Whether the reduced probability of plant sentience is enough to make expected plant pain lower than expected insect/zooplankton pain is unclear. Another consideration, as Hedonic Treader pointed out, is that plants respond much slower than animals, so maybe the <a class="postlink" href="../thread/491.html#p3951">effective clock speed</a> for plants is (orders of magnitude?) slower than for animals, which might be enough to dampen out their otherwise potentially massive expected value.<br/><br/>I don't know if plants would have net positive lives in the wild. Like with animals, most plant offspring probably die soon after pushing out of their seeds. Only a lucky few mature to adulthood, I would guess. Plants can also have stresses due to hostile weather, lack of food, drought, being eaten alive by herbivores, etc.<br/><br/>So I'm personally doubtful about LJM1979's suggestion that plant sentience could reverse the balance of pleasure/pain in nature. At least it would add more uncertainty, but even a priori, it's not clear why we'd assume that plant lives are net good (especially since the lives of the organisms we do know about -- small, short-lived animals -- are probably net bad). Sure, plants look peaceful, but who knows what kind of stress, fear, or deprivation of basic needs is going on inside their "heads" (internal communication systems). (Yes, that sentence was mainly tongue-in-cheek with wording, but the point was serious. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/> )<br/><br/>If plant lives aren't worth living, a lot of the interventions that we would support to reduce short-lived r-selected wild-animal populations would also reduce plant populations. Putting up parking lots, reducing plankton populations, palliating climate change, desertification, and land salination are things that tend to reduce not only animal populations but also plant populations. In general, a first-order approximation for the amount of animal life in an ecosystem is the amount of plant life, although it's possible this isn't always true. For example, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/fungicides.html">eutrophication may increase plant biomass while decreasing animal biomass</a>, but this suggestion remains counterintuitive and hence speculative.<br/><br/>As far as diets, the standard reply is that most meat production requires killing many times more plants than eating plants directly, so even if plants feel pain, it's better to be veg. This is probably true even when we consider wild animals because global warming will probably increase plant abundance in the long term.<br/><br/>Whether plants suffer or not also doesn't change the thrust of <a class="postlink" href="../thread/537.html">my futurism concerns</a>: Terraforming, panspermia, and sentient simulations will create at least as much plant life as animal life.<br/><br/>All in all, the things I'm working on aren't much affected if plants are sentient. Regardless, the issue doesn't keep me up at night, and I haven't formally included it in my calculations. The reason may be because I might decide that I just don't care about the computations that plants do as being conscious suffering. I'm <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/consciousness.html">allowed to do this if I want to</a>. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/> Now, if you show that the operations that plants do is really similar to operations done by animals that I care about, I may change my mind, but I think it's pretty unlikely the correspondence will be that strong.<br/><br/>As far as David Pearce's comments, I hold a very <a class="postlink" href="../thread/139.html#p6864">different view</a>. I don't believe there is a "hard" binding problem or that quantum mechanics is at all relevant. But I still agree with David on many things and owe a great deal to him; this is just a friendly intellectual disagreement. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Like me, you and Peter appear to assign an extremely low but nonzero probability to plant sentience. I don't mean to be a jerk, but it's not clear to me that you're taking that belief to its logical conclusion - or at least it's not clear to me why the expected value of total plant suffering in nature is low. If you have a very low probability but multiple it by an inconceivably high number (the # of plants in existence), it's still possible to come out with a meaningful value. I think Brian's answer about it complicating issues but not necessarily reversing the conclusion about a predominance of suffering in nature is helpful though.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Seemingly useless metaphysical debates can sometimes have profound ethical consequences. So I'm going to risk outlining my "philosophical" disagreements with Brian - even though ethically we agree on a lot! <br/><br/>IMO consciousness, for example a phenomenal pain, is concrete, possessing spatiotemporal location and causal efficacy; an algorithm is abstraction. I'm sceptical about any ultimate ontology of abstract objects (what might actually cause us to credit their existence?), even though, if we don't treat abstract objects as real for some purposes, we will miss many features of the real world. [Perhaps compare our understanding of functionalist / teleological explanations pre- and post-Darwin.] Thus natural selection has recruited e.g. pains to play, typically, an information-processing role in living organisms capable of self-propelled motion and capable of sustaining an energetically expensive nervous system. But neuropathic pain, for instance, that doesn't play any algorithmic or information-processing role in the organism is just as real as its "typical" counterpart. Consciousness, with or without any functional role, is not something mind/brains do: it's what they are.<br/><br/>Panpsychism? Presumably, we'll ultimately need rigorously to derive the phenomenology of our minds from the properties of the fundamental stuff of the world - a reductive physicalism with  no strong emergence, i.e. no unexplained eruption into the world of something ontologically new, not expressible within the mathematical straightjacket of modern physics. I don't think panexperientialism / Strawsomoan physicalsm can do this, or rather not on its own. Hence the seemly intractable binding problem and the classically inexplicable existence of "bound" phenomenal objects and the (fleeting, synchronic) unity of consciousness - and the desperate-sounding proposals that quantum mind theorists have devised to overcome the problem. But I don't think any proposal to solve the binding problem consistent with reductive physicalism can even get off the ground unless we assume a pan-experientialist / Strawsonian physicalist ontology. Such an ontology is the precondition of a reductive explanation of phenomenal minds, not an explanation  itself. <br/><br/>Two grounds for taking panexperientialism / Strawsonian physicalism seriously IMO are 1)  the fundamental entities in theoretical l physics (fields / superstrings / branes ) are defined purely mathematically; their supposed insentience is an extra assumption, not integral to the physics. And (2) the only part of the world to which one had direct access, namely one's own mind/ brain , has precisely those attributes that the pan-experientiallost / Strawsonian physicalist claims - contrary to one's naive materialist or abstract pan-informationalist intuitions. <br/><br/>More to be said ? Yes, for sure. <img alt=":-)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Many plants have toxins / thorns / etc. to try and prevent being eaten.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>LJM1979 wrote:</cite>I don't mean to be a jerk, but it's not clear to me that you're taking that belief to its logical conclusion<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Yeah, though there's a difference between plants/bacteria and sand grains. I mentioned it to Yew-Kwang Ng back in 2006, and he thought it was a good point. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/> The idea is just that, for sand grains and other inanimate objects, we have no idea whether any given action would increase or decrease their welfare. For plants and bacteria, we could assume that harming them biologically might induce suffering (in the unlikely event they can suffer at all), but for sand grains, what would cause them to suffer? Does it hurt them if we step on them on the playground?<br/><br/>I may reply to good ol' David another day, but it's getting late for tonight. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Arguably some of the biggest value in doing insect-sentience research isn't to influence our short-term decisions (even though we are really curious about the answer) but to set an example of showing that this question is one that people should care about. It frames the debate in a sentience-oriented way and suggests that it would matter morally if insects could suffer. These are notions that we're trying to make more common-sense in our culture.<br/><br/>I agree with Arepo that symmetry allows us not to worry about sand grains, but the same doesn't apply to plants for the reason Hedonic Treader explained. So yes, I do think plants are a problem that sand grains are not.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2"><blockquote><div><cite>davidpearce wrote:</cite>IMO consciousness, for example a phenomenal pain, is concrete, possessing spatiotemporal location and causal efficacy; an algorithm is abstraction. I'm sceptical about any ultimate ontology of abstract objects<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Me too. However, I'm not concerned about the algorithm in the abstract. Like you, I'm concerned about particular physical things that embody the algorithm. A cat-lover doesn't have to be a Platonist to say that she likes cats.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>davidpearce wrote:</cite>But neuropathic pain, for instance, that doesn't play any algorithmic or information-processing role in the organism is just as real as its "typical" counterpart.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Neuropathic pain still activates the algorithms we care about in the brain (i.e., algorithms of disliking, suffering, wanting to stop, etc.).<br/><br/>Animals masturbating are not fulfilling the purpose for which those inclinations evolved either. Sometimes things with one purpose are activated in other instances.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>davidpearce wrote:</cite>But I don't think any proposal to solve the binding problem consistent with reductive physicalism can even get off the ground unless we assume a pan-experientialist / Strawsonian physicalist ontology. Such an ontology is the precondition of a reductive explanation of phenomenal minds, not an explanation  itself.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>I don't believe there is a "hard" binding problem. The sensation of unity of conscious experience is an interesting one, but can ultimately be explained just like the sensation of breathing fresh air or the sensation of cosmic oneness with all things. The ideas Dave discusses seem to me akin to proposed solutions to how it is that the tooth fairy avoids going bankrupt.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>davidpearce wrote:</cite>the only part of the world to which one had direct access, namely one's own mind/ brain , has precisely those attributes that the pan-experientiallost / Strawsonian physicalist claims<br/></div></blockquote><br/>We have access to our brains only through mechanical operations. There's no "ghost of perfect emptiness," as Eliezer calls it, that has instantaneous, magical access to thoughts without any algorithms going on underneath. This feeling of having direct access to your mind and experiences is produced by complex algorithms that your brain is running in the physical world. If there really were a mysterious true consciousness to nature, how would that cause your brain to run these algorithms sensing it? Is the consciousness stuff like an elf that rewires neurons during the night to ensure that they run the right algorithms to reflect upon being conscious? Why not dispense with the elves and hypothesize that your brain just runs those algorithms on its own?<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>davidpearce wrote:</cite>More to be said ?

I'd agree with your argument that plant sentience probably wouldn't shift the balance to more pleasure than suffering in nature. However, if plants are sentient, then any RWA intervention that neglects their sentience could backfire - e.g., if the RWA intervention actually increased the number of animals that consume plants. If RWA leads to happy, healthy, active animals in nature who are burning lots of calories, they'd be eating lots of plants.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I suspect most practical RWAS measures would reduce plants along with reducing animals, but it is correct that some -- like replacing small, r-selected animals by bigger K-selected herbivores -- could at least keep the amount of plant eating constant.<br/><br/>My personal opinion (not shared by all of my colleagues) is that RWAS isn't primarily about helping animals on earth. It's about preventing the spread of life to other planets and in sentient simulations. Taking action on Earth has the primary value of making people realize that WAS is a problem and not something we should spread. Where possible, I'm going to nudge the RWAS movement to focus on the don't-spread-WAS-elsewhere side of the equation.<br/><br/>All of that said, you could take RWAS research findings and modify them to include consideration of potential plant suffering and see what kinds of conclusions pop out. A basic question is to ask how many plants there are compared with insects/zooplankton. If it's not orders of magnitude more, then maybe plants don't dominate the calculations after all.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2">(a) Pure solipsism basically doesn't matter in the calculations, because if you're the only mind that exists, the universe isn't very important. Solipsism where your brain somehow runs all the other brains doesn't seem like a hypothesis worth picking out as special. If those minds are really being run, then you should be equally likely to be any of them, not the single one that's crucial for the continued survival of all of them.<br/><br/>(b) This is along the lines of 2+2=5.

My essay on panexperientialism, available on this website under General Discussion, discusses this in detail. I think that only complex systems of one sort or another can suffer (fulfill the functional definition of suffering), so it is arguable that atoms cannot. However, perhaps under some functional definition of pain, subatomic particles can feel functional pain in that they are averse to entering some states––i.e., some states are underrepresented over all of the particle's different states across the UWF....Someone with more knowledge of QM than I will have to correct me here.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

The Marder-Francione debate was very interesting. I'll make a few notes. <br/><br/>A) Both generally argue their positions very well, although they are stuck in a deontological framework that I and most others here would object to. It is a shame that neither talks at all about total utility. <br/>B) Francione comes off as a bit close-minded to the mere possibility that plants are sentient. I wish Marder had asked him whether he would assign any nonzero probability (even one in a trillion!) to plant sentience. Even if plants are sentient, he says that "assuming that we concluded we were not obligated to commit suicide, we would still be morally obligated to consume plants rather than consume flesh or animal products" but I'm not convinced his deontological framework permits such an assumption. If plants are sentient, can his framework justify that each sentient human violate the right to life of an infinite number of sentient plants over his or her lifetime? <br/>C) Marder seems to push aside the issue of pain and suffering. He doesn't seem to believe there is a morally relevant difference between merely reacting to the environment without ever feeling pain and pleasure on the one hand and both reacting and feeling pain and pleasure on the other. <br/>D) Despite the above, it is good to see the moral philosophy community discuss plants.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I don't dispute that plants are in some ways intelligent, but of course, this isn't the same as being sentient. Even a thermostat is kind of "intelligent." None of the evidence presented seemed to suggest that sentience was involved, although it would be imprudent to put the probability too low -- say, lower than 0.0001.<br/><br/>The article takes a non-utilitarian ethical stance when it suggests that plants might deserve protection based on their abilities:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>But the novel indications concerning the responsiveness of plants, their interactions with the environment and with one another, are sufficient to undermine all simple, axiomatic solutions to eating in good conscience. When it comes to a plant, it turns out to be not only a what but also a who — an agent in its milieu, with its own intrinsic value or version of the good.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Well, by this definition, a Roomba might also be a "who." Your laptop would almost certainly be a "who." But I don't think these electronic items actually deserve ethical consideration.<br/><br/>I'm curious what the article meant by this:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Plants are also capable of refined recognition of self and non-self<br/></div></blockquote><br/>I'm guessing it was an anthropomorphic way to describe some very basic process.<br/><br/>This passage highlights what I said before about clock speed:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Plants, it is claimed by plant physiologists, are as sophisticated in behaviour as animals but this sophistication has been masked by the time scales of plants' response to stimuli, many orders of magnitude slower than animals'.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Methinks "as sophisticated in behaviour as animals" is a wee bit of exaggeration!</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
