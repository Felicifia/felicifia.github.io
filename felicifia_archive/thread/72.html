<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">For discussion of the responses in the <a class="postlink" href="../thread/49.html">original thread</a>.<br/><br/>One thing I wanted to pick up on:<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>RyanCarey wrote:</cite>Now, I note that some of your answers are circular reasoning. They just say "If you don't agree with us, then you're not a consequentialist". Well, what we're trying to do here is refute objections to utilitarianism persuasively. Some of the current arguments are no better than the argument "god wrote the bible, therefore the bible is true, therefore there is a god". In particular, I'm looking at<br/>Gordonhide's answers 1 &amp; 2<br/>DanielC's answers 2 &amp; 9</div></blockquote><br/><br/>This was my first reaction, and I think it's a reasonable point. But that said, we can divide objections to consequentialism another way: into those which argue that it's fundamentally illogical, and those which argue that it's just one of many options, which only our intuition can guide us between (basically Hare's two kinds of criticisms again).<br/><br/>Using circular arguments against these criticisms won't turn people consequentialist, but it might address the charge that util is inconsistent, if that's what you think they're claiming.<br/><br/>Still, in the long run the less circular approach is like to be more productive...<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>faithlessgod wrote:</cite>A good start but some stuff is too vague or too specific e.g. Objections to utilitarianism should to utilitarianism simpliciter not a specific version such as hedonic or happiness utilitarianism.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I just put in the objections I've heard a couple of times or more. Since I'm a CU, they tend towards objections about CU. But if you've heard any that apply more generally to util but not conseq, or that apply specifically to DU, let me know and I'll edit them in to the OP.<br/><br/>[quote=DanielLC]How about objections to nonconsequentialism? I think the idea that doing the right thing makes the world worse just seems wrong.[/quote]<br/><br/>Nonconsequentialism comes in all sorts of shapes and sizes, though. Apart from arguments in favour of consequentialism (which is basically what your line is, IMO), I don't think you'd find much to attack them all as a group. If there's a particular ethic you want to focus criticisms on, it'd probably be more helpful to start a separate topic for it.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Arguing that a non-consequentialist theory is circular says nothing about a consequentialist except, provided consequentialist arguments are non-circular is a logical argument for consequentialism on the basis that  circular arguments are no argument at all and so, by default, go to the back of the queue.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>I just put in the objections I've heard a couple of times or more.

This could generate a parallel Level 0/1 list focusing on arguments:<br/>Level 0: Against Non-Consequentialism<br/>Level 0: Against Egoism etc.<br/><br/>I suppose it is a question of positive (for your/our own) versus negative arguments (eliminating others)</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Exactly. Utilitarianism doesn't demand a cost-benefit analysis of the steps towards happiness any more than employment demands a cost-benefit analysis of the steps towards a job! What utilitarianism tells us is that analysing an analysis of an analysis to act is a bad idea. Because it won't make anyone happy. It tells us that there's an optimal level of learning, thinking and planning. Beyond this point, we should implement our plans, otherwise we are procrastinating. So utilitarianism can, like other theories, explain that procrastination tends to be a bad thing, and it can surpass other ethical theories by explaining why.<br/><br/>Here is another:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>In order to ensure consistency of application, a central committee would be assigned the task of evaluating consequences to a minute degree, and drawing up detailed tables of happiness values. These would at least govern every aspect of public life, if not personal life.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1"><blockquote><div><cite>RyanCarey wrote:</cite>Here is another criticism of Peter Singer and utilitarianism:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>An additional error in Singer's thinking is the assumption he makes that the suffering (or happiness) of individuals can somehow be added to each other and thus create "all this suffering in the world." C. S. Lewis explains that if you have a toothache of intensity x and another person in the room with you also has a toothache of intensity x, "You may, if you choose, say that the total amount of pain in the room is now 2x. But you must remember that no one is suffering 2x." There is no composite pain in anyone's consciousness. There is no such thing as the sum of collective human suffering, because no one suffers it. </div></blockquote><br/>It was drawn from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/medical_ethics/me0049.html">this essay</a></div></blockquote><br/>The sum of collective human suffering is an abstraction. Person A's toothache hurts him, so I'm willing to try to stop it. Person B's toothache hurts him, and I'm willing to try to stop that too. If I find a way to simultaneously make them both hurt less, I'd be twice as willing to do it. It's hitting two birds with one stone.<br/><br/>Look at it this way: suppose you want salt and you want pepper. You can't just add not having salt and not having pepper. Despite that, if you find a pack of salt and pepper, you'd be willing to pay twice as much as for just salt or just pepper.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">A specific example I've seen of objection number one is that utilitarianism would say that it's okay to steal under certain circumstances.<br/><br/>It is generally accepted that it is okay for the government to tax (i.e. steal) money to pay for public goods. It's slightly less generally accepted that it's okay for the government to steal from the rich and give to the poor to promote equality.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
