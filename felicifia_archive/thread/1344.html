<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Halløjsa!<br/><br/>I'm a new member of your forum, thanks to Brian Tomasik (thank you, Brian), so here's a bit about me:<br/><br/>My name is Magnus Vinding. What I do is that I write books, which I do because I believe it is one of the best ways to have a positive impact in the world -- it is the best one I can see, at least. "Our ideas matter immensely, so I try to spread good ones." That pretty much explains what I try to do and why.<br/><br/>What ideas do I try to spread, then? I think the idea that we should maximize our collective well-being -- the idea that appears to lie at the core of this forum -- is perhaps the most important one of all to spread. If we had a culture animated by that idea, and an entire society that lived accordingly with great dedication, we would be having a much better world. So I try to spread that idea in the hope of moving us closer toward that state. That is what I try to do in my book 'Moral Truths: The Foundation of Ethics' (<a class="postlink" href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/489831">https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/489831</a>) wherein I defend it as morally true. And spreading this idea is basically what try to do in my latest book too: 'The Meaning of Life: An Examination of Purpose' (<a class="postlink" href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/504618">https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/504618</a>).<br/><br/>I also try to figure out some of the basic implications of that general maxim and try to convey those (and that is also one of the main points of spreading that maxim: if we all had that maxim as a foundational idea, we would be an entire world thinking together about those implications). That has led me, like many of you, to be focused on non-human animals - the largely neglected group that makes up the vast majority of sentient beings on earth. On this subject I have written the book 'Why We Should Go Vegan'  (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IHPBCOS/">http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IHPBCOS/</a>) and the title pretty much says what that book is about. I have also written the book 'Why "Happy Meat" Is Always Wrong' (<a class="postlink" href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/435640">https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/435640</a>) that attacks the notion that it is okay to kill animals as long as they have lived good lives -- the apparently utilitarian idea that is anything but; indeed, this idea is nothing but the golden rationalization that keeps our entire horrible practice of factory farming and animal abuse going. As I argue in the book, as long as we have this idea, we will inevitably have factory farms and we will treat animals anything but well. I have also written the book 'A Copernican Revolution in Ethics' (<a class="postlink" href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/451958">https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/451958</a>) in which I argue for the ethical relevance of non-human animals, and the basic implications of taking their relevance seriously, perhaps most important: that we take wildlife suffering seriously, which most vegans also fail to take seriously. Nonetheless, as I argue, the importance of wildlife suffering only underscores the importance of veganism, since we will not take wildlife suffering seriously until we stop abusing them ourselves. That is the enormous importance of veganism: not only will it mean the end of the horrors we impose upon billions of non-humans every day, but it is also the first step toward this, in terms of numbers, much bigger problem of wildlife suffering.<br/><br/>Hopefully that gives a bit of a sense of what I do and the ideas I have. I am looking forward to be able to partake in your discussions. <img alt=":-)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Thank you <img alt=":-)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/><br/>Yes, "Why We Should Go Vegan" has been downloaded about 10,000 times in less than a year, which I cannot complain about. It is largely because Amazon has made it free -- about 7,000 of the downloads are from Amazon, where it gets about 15-30 downloads a day, and the best day was 293  <img alt=":shock:" src="../images/smilies/icon_eek.gif"/> It has also sold just short of 200 paperbacks, which is also quite cool, especially in light of the fact that it is free.<br/>Unfortunately, that's about it. The rest of my books all have downloads in the hundreds as far as I know. I'm sure they would be up there too if they were also free on amazon, as I wish they were and have tried to make them, but I don't seem to have any success with that (my reportings appear to end up in their spam filter <img alt=":-(" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif"/>...)<br/>In fact, you guys might be able to help make it free there. One only has to click on "tell us about a lower price" on the amazon page, and then insert a link to another page where it is free, and then write the price "0". That could be a huge help. I give some links below in case you would want to help -- any altruists out there?

Or you originally charged for the books but now want to make them free?<br/><br/>I did what you suggested about telling Amazon of a lower price for both the books. Note that the B&amp;N links that you pasted don't work because they were truncated when you pasted them, but I was able to find your books by searching the titles.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Thanks for your help <img alt=":-)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/> I hope it will have an effect.<br/><br/>It is indeed quite good numbers, and they are surely due to the enormous size of amazon. It is an enormous platform that reaches many people; the 6th biggest web page in the world or something like that. I can really recommend that you, and everybody else with good ideas to spread, publish some of your good material there. I also think it pays off in terms of how carefully people read material; I have read, and know it from myself, that when we read things in a browser, we rarely read very carefully, or even spend more than seconds reading individual articles/posts. Of course, it is also true that many people who download a book never even "open" it, yet I think it is good to give people the option to get the actual "book experience" of going deep down into the material. There is just another peace and immersion when one reads a book compared to reading something in a browser with a hundred tabs open. I have also encouraged David Pearce to publish his Hedonistic Imperative there, and his response was not quite satisfying <img alt=":(" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif"/> It could really expand its readership if it got up there, and it is even suggested in the search field if you start writing "hedonistic." So, Dave, if you read this, please do it. It is easy. And people demand your sweet stuff.  <img alt=":D" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif"/> <br/><br/>In case anyone is interested, this is where you publish: <a class="postlink" href="https://kdp.amazon.com/">https://kdp.amazon.com/</a><br/>It is really easy. And, just to make clear, I am not affiliated with them in any way. On the contrary, one might say, because they obviously don't like my idea of using them as a platform for free material (which they actually should, given that "free" increases their sales of paperback and sales overall, though probably not in the big big picture, where free would mean the death of their kindle sales...). And this leads to your question about price. Here is the thing: amazon does not allow you to price your material for free. 0.99 is their minimum price, and they don't like it (you only get half the royalties than you get from 2.99 and up, so they want you to price higher) -- and maybe no one should, given that prices like 3.99 and 2.99 may give higher sales than 0.99 cf. <a class="postlink" href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2013/05/new-smashwords-survey-helps-authors.html;">http://blog.smashwords.com/2013/05/new- ... hors.html;</a> some interesting buyer psychology going on it seems. The only way to make your book free on amazon is by making amazon make it free, which one does by reporting a lower price from another page. But there are no guarantees.<br/><br/>In terms of getting things on other pages, I use Smashwords and draft2digital, both of which are great and allow you to price things "free." With draft2digital you can easily get your stuff available for free on itunes, and there I have just short of 2000 downloads of "Why We Should Go Vegan," so it is also worth it.<br/><br/>Sorry for getting a bit nerdy  <img alt=":ugeek:" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_ugeek.gif"/>, but I think it is worth knowing and sharing these things, as it is relevant stuff to know in order to best reach people and have the greatest impact.  <img alt=":geek:" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_geek.gif"/> <img alt=":geek:" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_geek.gif"/></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

One only has to click on "tell us about a lower price" on the amazon page, and then insert a link to another page where it is free, and then write the price "0". That could be a huge help. I give some links below in case you would want to help -- any altruists out there? It only takes a few seconds. </div></blockquote></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
