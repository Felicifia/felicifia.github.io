<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Hi all,<br/>I'll just be blunt. I think it's highly unlikely that this guy has actually made a serious breakthrough in AI. I think the best approach is to be highly sceptical here because:<br/>1. He's promising something huge<br/>2. Here's being really secretive about it. He doesn't describe any of the current science of conscious AI or how he differs from it. He doesn't describe whether he's using more parallel processing as has been suggested. He doesn't describe his breakthrough...<br/>Big promises without substance = hype. I think in their life, everyone jumps on at least one hype train that ends up leading nowhere. Then they harden up and become a bit more sceptical. For me, at about 15, I followed the prospect of a collaboration between Nintendo and a fan organisation called Warp Pipe. Warp Pipe released tens of cryptic messages. Images, videos, the lot. It seemed that at announcement would not be far away at all. But then the project was cancelled and it came to nothing. I'm no longer sure the relevance of my story, but basically, this guy isn't making it easy for us to believe a thing he says.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
