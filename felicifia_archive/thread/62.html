This gets us bitten by people who assume that those conditions will be trivial and mostly irrelevant, and consquently react with horror.<br/><br/>The long answer is to define all those conditions: circumstances where a) no-one would find out that the killer would be set free and so encourage others to do the same, b) the question actually applied, in that despite the isolation of the family, there was a governing authority with the knowledge and power to choose whether or not to imprison him, and c) the killer's mental profile was so well known to said authority that its members knew beyond any reasonable doubt that he really wasn't more likely than anyone else to kill again (even having got away with it once).<br/><br/>In other words - yes in thought experiments, no in the real world.<br/><br/>A variation on the same theme is <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telishment">telishment</a> - punishing an innocent person to deter future wrongdoers. For essentially the same reasons, util will condone it in outlandish enough thought experiments, and condemn any suggestion that it should really happen.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Well we need to make sure that we don't ignore important factors:<br/>Firstly, I'd imagine that while things like food, shelter, social environment etc. would be similar for the offender and the non-offender, the fact that the non-offender is innocent could add to the psychological trauma. <br/>Secondly, those outside of prison may be traumatised by the idea that members of the public are falsely imprisoned. There's family of falsely imprisoned people. There's lobbyists who invest emotional resources to avoiding the situation you describe. Even those with no such connections might have fear struck through them by the idea of being picked taken to prison having done nothing.<br/>Thirdly, if the public become aware that non-offenders are imprisoned along with offenders, prison stops being a deterrent to offending</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Here is my promised answer on telishment. I can only answer here as a desire utilitarian others here might have different and complementary answers,<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>TraderJoe wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>faithlessgod wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>TraderJoe wrote:</cite>Presumably utilitarians agree that punishment is not an aspect of the judicial system,</div></blockquote><br/>I disagree why is not?

That would mean he is no longer a util. </div></blockquote><br/>Yes, for example imprisonment is a <span style="font-style: italic">prima facie</span> wrong - it thwarts the desires of the prisoner. However one needs to look at the <span style="font-weight: bold">overall effect</span> of imprisonment versus not in terms of <span style="font-weight: bold">everyone's desire fulfilment</span>. On that basis actions can be justified in terms of deterrence, protection, rehabilitation and restitution but <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> retribution - which reinforces and increases overall desire thwarting desires in a number of ways. Still safeguards are needed to minimize mistakes in making such decisions - such as due process, habeas corpus, fair trials,  humane conditions and so on. It is in everyone's welfare interests that this is so - telishment clashes with this as it is a claimed justification for imprisoning known innocent persons. <br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>TraderJoe wrote:</cite>Oh, gotcha - you're referring to the other aspects of imprisonment besides retribution, which I equate with punishment. Restitution I would expect most utils to reject, though protection [which I referred to] and rehabilitation [which I didn't, as I don't think imprisonment helps with this] I wouldn't.</div></blockquote><br/>Unless restitution decreases overall desire thwarting it is not justified. That is DU does not just endorse restitution but only of relevant kinds e.g. a graffiti tagger repainting building she defaced. Anyway we can leave this and the main argument will still apply.<br/><br/>The unsound assumption to argue for telishment is that utilitarianism (of any form) only uses imprisonment as a means of deterrence and nothing else. DU refutes this assumption, other utils might too.<br/><br/>Still let us accept this unsound assumption and examine its implication wrt only to DU. DU uses social forces including punishment as a means of modifying people's desires such that if they know that action might bring about condemnation and punishment  this is a deterrence to such actions (not guaranteed to work, of course, but an incentive nonetheless).  However these deterrents have to be carried out in order to be a meaningful deterrent else they are inert. One of the main issues that DU focuses on is that these social forces are used incoherently (e.g. on occasion praising certain desire thwarting behaviour, condemning other certain  desire fulfilling behaviours and so on)and applied inconsistently (e.g. let one get away with it but not another). It is in most everyone's interest that these social forces are used coherently and applied consistently as  they would be more efficient and effective as a deterrent that way and telishment would contradict this and impair the effectiveness of the social forces. (Of course history shows there is a long term dispute as to what system to coherently and consistently apply but that is outside the scope of this discussion). <br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>TraderJoe wrote:</cite>Right - but imagine a society where nobody bar the innocent themselves, and possibly some high-ranking bureaucrats, know that they are innocent. </div></blockquote><br/>I fail to see how this can be a justification for telishment in DU terms. It would still be the case that such actions increase desire thwarting overall. The guilty are free to commit desire thwarting crimes again and/or their associates would not be discouraged from doing so and an innocent is falsely imprisoned or worse.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Take any set of actions you can imagine, except one whose members are defined as 'doing more harm than good'. Utilitarianism will tell you that there's a conceivable situation in which you should perform an action from that set.*+<br/><br/>You don't need thought experiments to establish this point - it's true by definition!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>* In theory rule utilitarians would disagree. In practice, none of their rules will be absolute, so at worst you'll be excluding a few more members of the set - never all of them.<br/><br/>+ I'm not good with the maths-speak. Apologies if it sounds silly.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">About telishment, this strikes me pretty much impossible to do. You'd need to either fabricate evidence that nobody will ever find out you faked, or destroy evidence that nobody else will find (most likely the former). Most likely the former. Because more evidence can be found at any time, it is quite likely the parole board will find some evidence that contradicts your fabricated evidence, or find evidence that you destroyed evidence. The parole board is probably worth significantly more utility than the occasional telishment, as the only thing worse than later being found innocent is later being found innocent, but left in jail. What's more, you might later find the guy who did it, in which case you'd have to either destroy all evidence that he did it, which will be nigh impossible unless you're the first person to figure it out, or you have to show that the previous decision was faulty, in which case even if you avoid getting caught with tampering with evidence, will probably cause vastly more harm to the reputation of the justice system then the telishment would do good.<br/><br/>If you are going to assume that there's some powerful government conspiracy capable of getting away with this, instead of sending an innocent man to jail and pretending to send a guilty person to jail, they could just not send anybody to jail and pretend they sent a guilty person to jail.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
