<p class="author"><img alt="Post" height="9" src="../styles/nexus/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" title="Post" width="11"/>by <strong><a href="../user/180.html">spindoctor</a></strong> on 2011-06-09T16:24:00</p>
<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">What do you think is the "killer argument" for caring about animal suffering?<br/><br/>Here's the background. Recently, in Australia, there was a major animal abuse scandal that capivated the national media. Video footage came to light showing the shockingly cruel fate suffered by Australian cattle which had been shipped over to Indonesian abbatoirs. While the community reaction to the scandal was generally one of anger, not all on the left were so concerned. One progressive columnist I have otherwise admired, Guy Rundle, wrote a sloppy and disappointing <a class="postlink" href="http://imgur.com/a/592KM">column</a> on why caring about animals is a disaster for the left. (Screenshot because it was behind paywall). It's bad to care about animal torture because it leads us to care less about refugees, apparently.<br/><br/>I'm looking for a way to cut through to those, like Guy, who believe strongly that human suffering matters but simply do not care about animals. His stated position (made clear in the comments section, not linked) is that animals matter less than humans because humans have language, a sense of self and other, and a higher order grasp of their own existence.<br/><br/>What's a fast and effective utilitarian response to this? One gambit is that this implies that the suffering of infants and the profoundly intellectually disabled does not matter; but I think anthropocentric types like Guy would simply respond that these are minority edge cases, and that the vast majority of humans are smarter than animals and therefore (as a category, notwithstanding the edge cases) humans matter more.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Ask them on what grounds they think it's inappropriate to eat dogs. Ask them about extreme torture of farm animals for fun. Ask them all sorts of uncomfortable questions implied by their position.  <img alt=":?" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif"/></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">I wonder whether an empirical argument might appeal to those who say animal suffering doesn't matter.<br/><br/>Perhaps we could ask this. What is the physiological evidence that the experience of extreme pain (say being dropped alive into boiling water -- something not uncommon in some pig abbatoirs -- or beaten to death) is an order of magnitude worse for humans than for pigs? Do our language skills, sense of self and other, and other higher order traits so transform our feeling of pain that we suffer boiling water on an categorically different plane? Because the behavioural response that humans and pigs make is pretty comparable (cries of pain, writhing, trying to escape, etc). <br/><br/>I think another problem is getting across the subtlety of the point that we are not, in fact, asserting that animal suffering is the same as human suffering; that we are well aware of the higher order intellectual capacity of humans, and take that into account when considering their interests. It seems to me that some critics believe we hold the same views as Gary Francione-type animal abolitionists -- that human and animal rights are exactly alike, and that it is just as much of a crime to, say, keep a child in a cage as keep a bird in a cage.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

(I am an America.  My country is currently pretty conservative.  That's just where many of my fellow citizens are at this particular time.  So, even though I think I bat from the left side of the plate, compared to people in other countries, I might actually be pretty centralist.)<br/><br/>The classic Left sometimes criticizes the middle-class ('bourgeois') for focusing on small, petty issues when there are real problems going on.  For example, the news stories on whether a person should take yet another personal health precaution on what's a pretty marginal risk to begin with, and how few stories on . . .  Not even clean water in many parts of the developing world.  And how infantile diarrhea is a major cause of death.  That is, what is a mere embarrassment to those of us in the rich West is literally life and death to people with less money and less access to resources.  And, that around June 2009, the World Health Organization announced success with a trial of rotavirus vaccine.  Should have been a major news story, with lots of good background coverage, and generally was not.  Or, to take another issue, as I understand it is a major problem that women in the developing world breath smoke from cooking fires on a longterm basis.  In fact, I've heard this called something like a quiet catastrophe.<br/><br/>That said, Guy Rundle is just plain mistaken about this mistreatment of cows.<br/><br/>It is not a trivial amount of suffering.  People are directly right to care about it.  And indirectly, it's good that people exercise their heart muscle so to speak, that they get good at publicly speaking out about something and being active as citizens, and win (if possible) and see that substantial improvements are made.  And this may carry over in positive, unexpected ways.  That is, this flowing approach is much better than trying to build walls and tell people they should care about certain things and not care about other things.  People care about what they care about.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

How would we treat them?<br/><br/>Well, the initial answer is, if we know anything at all about modern humans, we would treat them appallingly.<br/><br/>But, often we do abuses to "prove" that some person or group is inferior.  And with Australopithecus obviously being intellectually inferior (although not necessarily in other ways), we may not have a strong desire to do so.<br/><br/>---------------<br/><br/>And sorry, cannot resist making this note:  As I understand it, not only are all modern humans in the same species, we're in the same subspecies.  And I recall reading in a biology book that, compared to a lot of animals, we modern humans actually have a relatively small amount of genetic diversity.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I don't know the literature in detail, but my impression is that cage-free is significantly better (like maybe -4 instead of -10 in terms of suffering per day). I think Bailey Norwood believes that conditions are better, and I tend to assume he knows what he's talking about. From <a class="postlink" href="http://www.choicesmagazine.org/magazine/article.php?article=89">one article</a> that he coauthored:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>It is true that the UEP standards are based on scientific studies, but there are many studies backing HSUS’s claim that cage-free eggs are superior to cage eggs in terms of animal welfare, and the ranking of a system depends on the rankers’ particular values and perceptions (Fraser, 2002). In fact, every study we know that ranks egg systems in terms of animal welfare ranks cage-free systems ahead of cage systems in terms of providing animal care (De Mol, 2006; LayWel, 2004).<br/></div></blockquote></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Once you do that, you may be more receptive to the point you linked to. But I'm assuming humanity is going to last for quite a while after this.<br/><br/>The best elevator pitch I can think of is: "Imagine that veganism was the position that the majority of society expected. What food was made available in the average restaurant, festival, or dinner party would be cooked for vegans, and being vegan would be easy. Most people would probably go along with it. And they would all believe the arguments that you've heard a million times from vegans. So for most people, in a very important sense, the position they defend with arguments they believe are their real reasons is not their own. You are a celebrity of some sort, and have influence over society. Please don't just follow the people who are following you."</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
