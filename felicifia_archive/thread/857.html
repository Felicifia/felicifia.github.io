<p class="author"><img alt="Post" height="9" src="../styles/nexus/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" title="Post" width="11"/>by <strong><a href="../user/64.html">Brian Tomasik</a></strong> on 2013-03-11T17:35:00</p>
<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><span style="font-weight: bold">Summary</span><br/><br/>Nick Bostrom's "<a class="postlink" href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html">Astronomical Waste</a>" suggests that a reasonable estimate of the number of human minds that could be computed in the future is ~10^38 at any given moment. This figure seems potentially high to me because it assumes colonization of the entire Virgo Supercluster, and I also don't know if the estimates of the computation per star and computation per brain are overly optimistic. An extremely skeptical outlook could reduce the expected number of minds to a much smaller magnitude -- possibly even not substantially more than the number of biological minds. However, in practice, we have to look at expected values rather than conservative estimates, and the Pascalian tail scenarios will ensure that the expected importance of influencing the future remains high even if we think our likely impact on it is low.<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">Note</span>: As many readers know, I fear that massive amounts of future computation <a class="postlink" href="../thread/537.html">may lead to astronomical amounts of suffering</a>, and I'm not a fan of colonization for this reason. I would prefer to avoid colonizing our supercluster, but, barring that, I hope we can at least reduce the number of suffering computations that take place.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Introduction</span><br/><br/>Predictions are hard, especially about the future. There's immense uncertainty about how things will play out and whether something we do now will have a good or bad impact. In addition, entropy diffuses the influences that we do have, such that over time, the probability that what we do now still matters is smaller and smaller, except in cases where there are specific mechanisms to prevent this damping effect, such as with a goal-preserving AGI.<br/><br/>These factors militate against trying to influence the future, especially the far future. However, the usual reply is that the amount of consciousness (including suffering) in the future could be so vast that, even if it's unlikely to come about, and even if our control over it is likely to be small, our expected impact by working on futurism issues still dominates present-day considerations. Thus, we'll tend to view present-day considerations mainly from the lens of how they shape the future.<br/><br/>I think all of this is correct, but I'm curious just how big the number of future minds could be using a truly conservative estimate. In "Astronomical Waste," Bostrom talks about 10^38 human-level minds that could exist for "the lifespan of galaxies," i.e., "billions of years." 10^38 is a product of 10^13 stars in the Virgo Supercluster times 10^42 computing operations per second per star divided by 10^17 operations per second per human mind. Let's examine these numbers.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">10^13 stars</span><br/><br/>The Virgo Supercluster is big. Its <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_Supercluster">diameter is</a> ~10^8 light-years across, and given that even the best space travel would probably be many times slower than light, it could take billions of years to cross it. By the time we finished, the party might already be over? (Here I use "party" as an expression, but in fact, the computations of the future may contain vast amounts of suffering.)<br/><br/>Alpha Centauri, the nearest star, is 4.3 light-years from us, and <a class="postlink" href="http://earthsky.org/space/alpha-centauri-travel-time">one article</a> estimates: "The Voyagers [spacecraft] aren’t aimed toward Alpha Centauri, but if they were, they’d take tens of thousands of years to get there." So maybe spacecraft would be ~10^4 times slower than light, which means it could take 10^12 years to cross the Virgo Supercluster.<br/><br/>A <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_the_universe#Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe">scenario for the end of the universe</a> that is considered most likely is the Big Freeze, in which "Over a time scale on the order of 10^14 years or less, existing stars burn out, stars cease to be created, and the universe goes dark." If this is true, then even if it took 10^12 years to cross the Virgo Supercluster, we'd still have 10^14 - 10^12 ~= 10^14 years left.<br/><br/>Of course, this isn't the only possibility. In the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Rip">Big Rip scenario</a>, "the end of the universe is approximately 22 billion years from the present," although this particular number "is not considered a prediction, but a hypothetical example." If it were correct, though, the universe would last ~10^10 more years, which means we might not be able to colonize very much of the Virgo Supercluster before time ran out. Anyway, <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terasecond_and_longer">note that</a> "Experimental evidence currently suggests that" the Big Rip is not accurate.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">10^42 computing operations per second per star</span><br/><br/>For this figure, Bostrom cites R. J. Bradbury's "Matrioshka Brains" paper, which I can't find immediately on the web. Without having read it, I remain mildly skeptical because there may be large differences between theory and practical feasibility.<br/><br/>Maybe we can take a bottom-up approach. Today's typical computers <a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_many_FLOPS_does_the_average_computer_run_at">run at speeds in the gigaflops</a> (say, 10^10 flops), and there are probably around as many computers as there are humans (~10^10?). It seems reasonable to expect we can increase both the speed per computer and the number of computers, so maybe ~10^25 or ~10^30 would be a conservative estimate for future computing power on Earth. (Here I'm assuming a flop is the same as what Bostrom calls an "operation per second.")<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">10^17 operations per second per human mind</span><br/><br/>Since <a class="postlink" href="../thread/139.html">I may care about as much about insect-level minds as human minds</a> (pending discoveries about <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/insect-pain.html">whether insects are sentient</a>), we can actually reduce this number down from 10^17. I don't know exactly how the scaling would work, but assume it's roughly proportional to number of neurons. A <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_by_number_of_neurons">human has ~10^11 neurons, compared with ~10^5 in a fruit fly</a>. The difference is 10^6, so maybe it would require only ~10^17 / ~10^6 = ~10^11 operations per second for a fruit fly.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Combining the numbers</span><br/><br/>On Earth, assuming ~10^25 to ~10^30 flops, and ~10^11 flops per fruit fly, we would have ~10^14 to ~10^19 (suffering) fruit flies, which is at most about the same as <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/number-of-wild-animals.html">the number of insects in nature</a>. If we use the original 10^42 flops estimate, then we could simulate 10^31 (suffering) fruit flies on Earth alone, which is noticeably bigger.<br/><br/>However, to this 10^31 figure, we have to apply major discounts for (a) the probabilities that a computational future doesn't happen, (b) the probability that the computing power is used for non-sentient minds, (c) the probability the sentient minds are much bigger than fruit flies, (d) the probability that what we do now isn't useful, (e) damping factors for our influence even if what we do now is useful, and (f) many other things. Multiplying these all together could conceivably give something at least as small as 10^-10, say. Of course, there are plenty of discounts and damping factors for preventing the suffering of biological insects that already exist on Earth too, but not as many as for future computational suffering.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">The tails dominate</span><br/><br/>A super-conservative estimate of future computational consciousness may not be really huge, but the expected value for the magnitude is a lot bigger. Maybe the universe will last longer than we thought, or maybe we'll find other loopholes in physics that allow for escaping these limits. Maybe Matrioshka Brains can simulate more minds than we thought. Maybe fruit flies are inefficient, and we can actually get away with even smaller brains. Or maybe the intensities of emotion could be multiplied many-fold over what fruit flies experience if they're sentient even with the same number of flops.<br/><br/>Because I fear that in expectation, the amount of suffering in the future may exceed the amount of happiness using <a class="postlink" href="../thread/852.html">my personal assessments of happiness vs. suffering</a>, I hope these big-computation scenarios are not true, but if they are, the results would be devastating. In our calculations, we have to take them seriously, and the probabilities of weird big-computation scenarios may not fall as fast as the size of potential computation grows. (This is trivially true if we assign nonzero probability to physical <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercomputation">hypercomputation</a>.) So even if you're skeptical about how big future computation might be, you'll still likely be compelled by the Pascalian tails of the probability distributions.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Comments?</span><br/><br/>Let me know if you think I'm being overly skeptical or if there are major factors I haven't considered. This whole analysis could use a lot of refinement and expansion, so consider this just a quick, first-pass attempt.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Relativistic effects are negligible until you're at like 0.1c and as long as you have fuel you can keep accelerating. If we're assuming top-notch technology and digital minds, the mass could theoretically be quite small. Stuart Armstrong has a fun and interesting <a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQTfuI-9jIo">talk</a> all about this and other related issues. There are also some relevant ideas about incentives to colonize even for civilizations that have no desire to colonize.<br/><br/>Also, most stars may burn out by 10^14, but the universe doesn't end at this point. There is vast time afterwards, though I'm not sure how many flops are possible at these later times.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">One difference I notice between what you did and my own attempts is that you give computing speed to stars. I give computations per energy unit. If we can't use the power as it comes, then we can disassemble the stars and do it slower, or just mine the stars and build more computers.<br/><br/>The temperature of space is 2.7 Kelvins. At this temperature, a computer can theoretically delete nearly 4*10^22 bits per Joule (if it uses reversible computing and doesn't delete anything, there is no theoretical limit). Using your value for operations per second on a human mind, this gives about 80 Joules per human life year. We can probably get by with reversible computing for most operations, which could increase the efficiency.<br/><br/>Also, I agree with amc. Going at near light speeds is difficult, but far from impossible. Doubling the size of a rocket to increase the speed by a factor of one in a thousand doesn't sound like a good idea, but when travelling a million light years it will save you a millennium. You can assume light speed. The amount less than this will be tiny compared to the other errors in calculation.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

This discount may be too small -- I'm not sure. In any event, I don't claim it's at all precise, but I agree with Robin Hanson that if you at least state some kind of estimate, that allows for more discussion of how right/wrong it is compared against saying vague things like "really small," which is "not even wrong" because it's not precise.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>Also I'd suggest making the essay less pinned to your more controversial (among utilitarians) views, eg on insect brains if they're sentient at all being experientially equivalent to human brains; I find this so improbable a priori that I all but ignore the conclusion of any argument conditional on it.<br/></div></blockquote><br/><img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/><br/>Fair enough.

That said, these are highly speculative estimates based on things that we don't know are possible. The theoretical bounds on energy to computation are worth thinking about, but there's no guarantee we can get anywhere close to them in reality. Plus, maybe the kinds of minds we choose to care about are more narrow than any arbitrary computation. Maybe we'd want them to have a specific sort of structure whose creation would be limited by raw materials, etc. How much computer-creating substrate is there in planets, anyway?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>Is this an argument against the haste consideration?</div></blockquote><br/>No, because the haste consideration is about building your movement now. Long-term entropy effects are about whether your movement will sustain what it achieves decades, centuries, millions of years from now.<br/><br/>When you and your movement are alive, that's great. The problem comes when you die and your movement potentially dies. The question is whether your values can be locked in permanently (e.g., through goal preservation in AGI) or whether they'll be lost through entropy and selection pressures.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Even though a solid Dyson sphere or ring world is difficult, it is not difficult to have independently orbiting satellites that capture most of the sun's light. As for the mass required, we can already make solar panels only a few microns thick, and the CPUs should be less mass than the solar panels, so mass would not be a limiting factor, unless it happened to require something rare (unlike silicon and carbon).</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
