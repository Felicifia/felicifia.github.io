<h3><a href="#p1919">Promoting awareness of animal emotions?</a></h3>
<p class="author"><img alt="Post" height="9" src="../styles/nexus/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" title="Post" width="11"/>by <strong><a href="../user/64.html">Brian Tomasik</a></strong> on 2010-05-13T23:10:00</p>
<div class="content"><div class="postrev hidden" data-snap="0">There's a group on Facebook that I like a lot -- it's called "Promote Awareness of the Emotional and Intelligent Lives of Animals." It highlights books and articles that describe how much animals sometimes share with humans in terms of cognitive abilities and affective states.<br/><br/>I'm curious: How effective would it be for animal advocates to publicize these types of findings? For instance, would this be a good way to make people <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-nature.html">care about wild-animal suffering</a>? Better than promoting vegetarianism?<br/><br/>I ask because I think that would have been true in my case. For many years, I scoffed at vegetarians because I thought animals were cognitively inferior to humans to an extent that they didn't really feel pain in a bad way. It was only upon reading Singer's "<a class="postlink" href="http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/singer03.htm">Do Animals Feel Pain?</a>" (thanks to a link on <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian.net/">Utilitarian.net</a>) that I realized that animal emotions even mattered. At that point, vegetarianism (and lots of associated conclusions) followed naturally.<br/><br/>In addition, with respect to wild animals, it's not entirely clear whether the net balance of happiness or suffering in nature is negative (though I suspect <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/wild-animals.pdf">it probably is negative</a>, considering that most animals that come into existence die soon after birth). Ideally, we'd like people just to <span style="font-style: italic">care more</span> about the question so that they'll do further research and eventually reach better conclusions. At that point, they could decide whether the planet should have more or less wildlife habitat.<br/><br/>That said, I worry about two things:<br/><br/>(1) Cognitive biases tend people toward optimism (see section 5 of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/wild-animals.pdf">this piece</a>), coupled with the fact that the humans we're talking about live relatively comfortable lives. One's own internal affective state makes a huge impact on one's assessment of the overall quantities of happiness and suffering that exist, and most people making decisions about these matters do so in the comfort of their temperature-controlled, predator-free, and food-stocked homes and offices.<br/><br/>(2) Even people who agree that wild animals suffer more than they're happy often still favor wilderness preservation, because they value things (like beauty, complexity of ecosystems, or natural evolutionary processes) apart from subjective experiences by individual organisms. In fact, I've met only a handful of non-utilitarians to whom the idea of <a class="postlink" href="http://robertwiblin.wordpress.com/2010/01/21/just-destroy-nature/">letting nature vanish</a> is not repugnant. One friend of mine is even dedicated to spreading life throughout the universe as widely as possible even though he agrees wildlife suffer enormously.<br/><br/>So, in addition to highlighting how much animals are similar to humans, it's important as well to remind people that the circumstances in which most animals live are quite different and that those differences matter a lot in answering the question of how best to help wild animals.<br/><br/>Finally, I wonder whether promoting awareness of animal emotions may not be necessary for most people. To many pet owners, for instance, a dog's ability to feel pain is obvious. Maybe it tends to be the overly academic and rationalist crowd that has the hardest time acknowledging animal suffering -- I think my own former skepticism about animal pain derived from some weird notion that language was essential for subjective experience. In this case, highlighting intellectual portrayals of animal abilities might appeal to just a small minority of the population; perhaps there are better strategies for "the average Joe"?<br/><br/>Of course, it's also worth asking which people are most important to influence. With respect to vegetarianism, perhaps any type of person is roughly the same, but with respect to changing future memes, it's those who will shape the future of public opinion who matter most. Who are those people, by the way?</div>

<h3><a href="#p1920">Re: Promoting awareness of animal emotions?</a></h3>
<p class="author"><img alt="Post" height="9" src="../styles/nexus/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" title="Post" width="11"/>by <strong><a href="../user/247.html">Jason Kilwala</a></strong> on 2010-05-14T00:13:00</p>
<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Thanks for the reference to the Facebook group: I joined.<br/><br/>While (1) may be a legitimate concern with this approach, I doubt that (2) is. I would guess that increased awareness of similarities between humans and animals would increase rather than decrease concern for subjective experiences over "intrinsic beauty of nature."<br/><br/>I think that if people are going to destroy nature out of concern for animals' well being, it's going to be as a result of a gradual increased understanding that animals are similar to us and that they're leading lives that we would not want to live rather than as a consequence of an expected returns calculation.<br/><br/>(Incidentally, I wonder whether consideration of sufficiently small probabilities may actually be methodologically flawed rather than just counterintuitive - my feeling related to the possibility of variations on  <a class="postlink" href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/kd/pascals_mugging_tiny_probabilities_of_vast/">Pascal Mugging</a> messing up systematic consideration of very small probabilities.)<br/><br/> I don't know who will shape the future of public opinion. But I do think it important to systematically investigate how the average person thinks about these things to avoid falling into the pattern of <a class="postlink" href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/">generalizing from one example</a>. If you start an organization devoted to increasing concern for wild animals, an important task for such an organization would be to assess present attitudes toward animals among representatives of a wide swath of the population. In the short term you might go to a park and strike up conversation with pet owners asking them what they think about these things.<br/><br/>I suspect that owners of dogs and cats have more awareness of similarities between humans and other animals than other people do. It would be interesting to know about the extent to which this is the case, and also what their attitudes are toward other animals (pigs on farms, mammals in the wild, non-mammals in the wild).</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Thanks for the comments, Jason, and welcome to Felicifia!<br/><br/>I don't quite see the Pascalian nature of the wild-animal question, unless you're thinking that uncertainty about <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/insect-pain.html">whether insects feel pain</a> would tip the balance one way or the other. Wouldn't our attitude toward wildlife always be based on "a gradual increased understanding that animals are similar to us and that they're leading lives that we would not want to live"?<br/><br/>Your suggestions about assessing public opinion are well taken: Indeed, this is a crucial first step for anyone endeavoring to change public attitudes. I like to bring up the wild-animal topic as often as I can during conversations, partly for this reason (and partly for the immediate benefit of allowing my interlocutor to ponder the question).</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Well, okay, the wild-animal question is not Pascalian in the sense of involving small probabilities. I guess what I really meant is that "animal suffering" and "animal happiness" are in a certain sense quite abstract at the moment and that for most people to care about animal utility as much as you do, they would need more visceral exposure to the experiences of animals than you do. Even watching a videos of animals being gored may not be enough to get people to care significantly about animals. What would really help is if we had technology that allowed people to mind-meld with various animals for a direct taste of what their experiences are like.<br/><br/>Anyway, what I was trying to say is that the breakdown of the human/animal barrier in people's minds is crucial for serious ethical consideration of animals and that this breakdown has not yet occurred. Disseminating knowledge of similarities between animals and humans would seem to help.<br/><br/>As for assessing public opinion - keep in mind that the people who you see on a day to day basis are not representative! At some point you'll want to diversify the people who you talk to about this matter in a systematic way.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">I agree with Jason's points, especially about mind-melding. Anecdotally, I found De Waal's books about chimpanzees to be emotional eye openers regarding the emotional lives of animals. Of course, chimps are more similar to humans than they are to many other animals but it is an important first step to realize that some animals have emotional lives very much like human emotional lives.<br/><br/>Alan, is that essay new? I haven't seen it on your site before.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Jesper, which essay are you referring to? The one on insect pain has been up for a while; the one on swappable minds is not mine. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/><br/><br/>I'm glad you found De Waal's accounts eye-opening. I remember that my eyes were opened to such animal abilities in a few pages from Singer's <span style="font-style: italic">Practical Ethics</span> and then <span style="font-style: italic">Animal Liberation</span>. Funny, actually. I had grown up my whole life watching nature programs on television and raising animals on a farm, and yet it wasn't until reading Singer's account that I ever thought of animal suffering as an important issue. Moreover, it took me several weeks / months -- combined with Dave Pearce's writings -- to convince me that suffering in the wild was a huge issue. This goes to show that modus ponens is a slow operation and shouldn't be expected to occur on its own! (I'm facetiously acting as though moral conclusions are facts here, for rhetorical effect.)</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

However, I think demonstration of empathy is more powerful evidence.<br/><br/>As we've discussed several times before <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/>, I make a distinction between unconscious emotion-type behaviors (e.g., nociception against injurious stimuli) and conscious awareness of one's emotional state. I only care about the latter. If you have empathy, then you presumably can guess approximately what it feels like to be in another's situation, and if you can do that, most likely you can reflect on what your own emotions feel like. So it may be that empathy requires conscious experience (at least within all brain architectures that exist on earth today).<br/><br/>In contrast, it's easier for me to imagine excitement happening without conscious awareness. Slugs get sexually aroused, for example, but they're not necessarily conscious. (Of course, they might be, which is why I still care about them, in proportion to their probability of being conscious.)</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
