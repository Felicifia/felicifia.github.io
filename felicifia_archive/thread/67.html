I work as a software developer but was trained as a physicist.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Well, no, I don't see much more to say. I was happy to stumble on this forum, and like the little I have found time to read.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Hey David, welcome to the good ship SS Felicifia. Lifeboats are to the top-right and top left of your browser <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/><br/><br/>Good to see we have a physicistician (ahem) on board. You should be able to find a few people around here who'll be willing and able to talk physics with you if that's your thing ... personally I find it fascinating, but on a <span style="font-style: italic">New Scientist</span> rather than <span style="font-style: italic">Journal of Synchrotron Radiation</span> kind of level. So if you follow general interest physics news, I hope you'll post some of that here too. It would be great to get enough of that kind of discussion to justify creating a science subforum. <br/><br/>Out of curiousity, are you originally French? I've never come across a French utilitarian before - French philosophers, more than those any other nation I could name, seem committed to the Lacan/Foucault etc continental style of philosophy.<br/><br/>And congratulations on becoming a father!

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Thanks to both for your kind welcome!<br/><br/>Arepo, don't expect too much from me concerning the current state of science, especially as regards physics. I did study up to the level of a specialisation in particle physics, but that was a long time ago and the state of knowledge has evolved, and my mastery of the concepts and of the math has become a bit rusty.<br/><br/>I but I also feel that distancing oneself from the particular details of physics can allow to take a larger perspective on things.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>Out of curiousity, are you originally French? I've never come across a French utilitarian before - French philosophers, more than those any other nation I could name, seem committed to the Lacan/Foucault etc continental style of philosophy.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I'm both French and English. Born in London to a US American mother and a French father. I lived in London to the age of 12, then since then in France. And my wife is Italian, so I'm “a bit of a mutt” too, like the future US president...<br/><br/>I remember formulating and adopting what amounted to utilitarianism when I was 8 or 9 and living in London. I don't know exactly what it has to do with English culture vs. French, or a Protestant background vs. a Catholic one, but I have often wondered. However, in any case, the divide you mention in philosophy between the “Anglo-Saxon” and “continental” styles of philosophy is not that absolute. There is a <span style="font-style: italic">Centre Bentham</span> in France, that is organizing a <a class="postlink" href="http://bentham.free.fr/Colloque_Rennes_english.html">conference</a> next June — one I hope to contribute to, with a presentation on the issue of personal identity and the ideas of Derek Parfit. On the other hand, there is also an anti-utilitarian tradition in English-speaking countries, one that sometimes be just as violent as the French anti-utilitarians.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>RyanCarey wrote:</cite>Good luck with becoming a child</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Er...

I'm more interested in the cultural implications of being an 'open' utilitarian in France. I have a mental image of it being quite stigmatized, since so many of the 'big names' of French humanities and social sciences are from the continental school.

I feel frustrated too with something I can't define very well about it. Perhaps it has to do with his writing style, or perhaps it is his way of reasoning. Says some very radical things, and then comes to meek conclusions about them, relying on his intuition about some key points (like the rejection of the so-called “repugnant conclusion”), which is a sure way to reach only meek conclusions.<br/><br/>David</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<h3><a href="#p458">Re: I'm new too (David Olivier)</a></h3>
<p class="author"><img alt="Post" height="9" src="../styles/nexus/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" title="Post" width="11"/>by <strong><a href="../user/82.html">David Olivier</a></strong> on 2008-12-01T02:27:00</p>
<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>By the way, since you're preparing a paper on it, would you care to elaborate on what you mean by 'personal identity doesn't exist', so I can see if we agree as much as I suspect we do?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>You have done me a favour by asking that question, since it obliges me to start putting to words what I have in mind, and that is an excellent thing for me.<br/><br/>The difficulty is in explaining what that thing that I say doesn't exist — personal identity — is, that is what it is in the minds of those who believe in it. And actually, almost everyone believes in it, or at least acts, and emotionally reacts, as if ey believed in it.<br/><br/>I obviously do not deny that there is a strong connection between the mind that occurs in the body that is typing this text right now, and the mind that will occur in the body commonly identified as “mine” tomorrow morning. There is a strong <span style="font-style: italic">causal</span> connection, for instance in the production tomorrow morning of memories in that mind of what “I” am doing right now. What I believe, to borrow Parfit's expression, is that there is no <span style="font-style: italic">further fact</span> in that relation.<br/><br/>Sentience — the fact that there are sensations, emotions and so on — is I believe something that we cannot currently explain. Others believe it is within the scope of current science. But either way, sentience is just that: feelings — <span style="font-style: italic">sentiency events</span> — that occur in certain physical bodies at specific times. There is nothing in a sentiency event that implies a further object, an <span style="font-style: italic">I</span>, to which it should be ascribed. Such an <span style="font-style: italic">I</span> is an imaginary further fact, one we have no reason to believe in.<br/><br/>A few examples of this belief in personal identity that I am criticizing.<br/><br/>The first is from a short science fiction story by Theodore Sturgeon that I have read recently, called <span style="font-style: italic">It Opens the Sky</span>. The passage below is about a planet, Grebd, that offers its services to people who have commited some crime and wish to escape from the autorities:<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Sturgeon wrote:</cite>Grebd was the name of a sun, a planet and a city in the Coalsack matrix, where certain of the inhabitants had developed a method of pseudosurgery unthinkably far in advance of anything in the known cosmos. They could take virtually any living thing and change it as drastically as it wanted to be changed, even from carbon-base to boron-chain, or as subtly as it might want, like an alteration of all detectible brainwave characteristics or retinal patterns, or even a new nose. They could graft (or grow?) most of a whole man from a tattered lump, providing it lived. Most important, they could make these alterations, however drastic, and (if requested) leave the conscious mind intact.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>What is meant here by “leaving the conscious mind intact”? A fugitive wants to escape future identification by changing physically as completely as possible; but still wants the future entity to be <span style="font-style: italic">him</span>. He doesn't just want there to be some future being with sentiency events occuring in it; he wants those sentiency events to be <span style="font-style: italic">his</span>. The fact that the physical change may even involve replacing each and every molecule in his body (“from carbon-base to boron-chain” (whatever <span style="font-style: italic">that</span> may be!  <img alt=":D" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif"/> )), while leaving intact that object that is “him”, illustrates the non-physicality of that notion of personal identity. And the fact that this passage is so readily understood by the reader shows that we <span style="font-style: italic">do</span> generally believe that such an idea of personal identity makes sense.<br/><br/>The fugitive who goes to Grebd wouldn't be satisfied just to know that the future “boron-chain” entity will be made to remember the experiences that he is having. He wants the mind of the future entity to be <span style="font-style: italic">his</span> mind. If it wasn't his mind, but another mind, he wouldn't even believe that those memories are real memories, however undistinguishable they might be, from the point of view of that entity, from real memories. This shows that the notion of personal identity does not coincide with the existence of psychological continuities such as memory. It is seen as a further fact, something that does or does not hold, independently of such continuities.<br/><br/>That can also be seen through the idea of reincarnation. Some people who believe in reincarnation think that we keep, perhaps deeply embedded in our subconscious, memories of our past lives. But those memories are tenuous at best; and no doubt some believe in totally amnesic reincarnation, that is without any memory at all of our past. They believe that it is a fact that some future person is, or is not, the same as some past person, even in the absence of any physical or psychological continuities.<br/><br/>Instead of reincarnating, a lot of people believe that their souls will go to heaven or hell. In some forms of Catholic belief, particularly it seems in that of John Paul 2, the soul is seen as quite distinct from any stream of consciousness, that is of sentinecy events. It is seen as existing before sentiency appears at all; that is the justification of the opposition to abortion. The “human person” exists from conception, even if it is not, and has never been in its past, sentient.<br/><br/>The <span style="font-style: italic">Catechism of the Catholic Church</span> <a class="postlink" href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c1a2.htm">gives a fine expression</a> of the idea of personal identity:<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Catechism of the Catholic Church, par. 2159 wrote:</cite>The name one receives is a name for eternity. In the kingdom, the mysterious and unique character of each person marked with God's name will shine forth in splendor. "To him who conquers . . . I will give a white stone, with a new name written on the stone which no one knows except him who receives it."</div></blockquote><br/><br/>That's it: something mysterious and unique, that, like a stone, cannot be divided or fused with other entities of the same kind. I believe that Christian doctrine has in great part imprisoned us mentally in what Parfit calls a “tunnel”: the belief that there is something supremely particular in our relation to our future sentiency events, a relationship uncomparable to that between sentiency events in different persons.<br/><br/>Now it's getting very late in my timezone, so I'll stop here, and not go into the consequences I think the rejection of the concept of personal identity has for ethics — I mean, relatively to the fact that we seem to think it obvious that we should care for what happens to “us” tomorrow, but not at all obvious that we should care about what happens to “others”. I hope what I have written above is not too unclear, enough for you to recognize if it is indeed what you yourself believe on the matter.<br/><br/>David</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I think the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus">Theseus' Ship</a> 'paradox' highlights this pretty well. In that example, you have to be into some pretty religious metaphysics to think there's anything to say about what's going on besides swapping timbers. The human brain (and its effects) are another example of the same non-problem.<br/><br/>Sorry I can't offer better feedback here - I simply agree (and think it's quite obvious once you've thought to pose the question, though most people seem to disagree...). I'd like to hear what implications you think it has for ethics though, since while I have some views on that, they're less well developed.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
