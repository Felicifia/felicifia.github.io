Many psychologists refer to it as cBt (lower case c, capital b). Many of the studies that compare CBT to just BT find no enhanced outcome from the C, although a smaller # do find the C makes a difference. Sometimes our thinking affects our feelings but there are many more times when it doesn't. (e.g., "I know I shouldn't have this fear of flying but I just do." "I know I shouldn't consume this substance but I can't help it.") At other times, we may mistakenly think our cognition is impacting our thinking when the cause is really behavioral - for example, you are stressed out, you exercise, and then your thinking becomes more optimistic and you feel better. You might incorrectly attribute the mood change to new thinking. I happen to be much more sympathetic to Skinner's radical behaviorism (<a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_behaviorism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_behaviorism</a>) than most though.<br/><br/>My take home point: You want to think and feel differently, start behaving differently and re-structuring your environment.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Buddhists (in the USA) often speak of "cultivating compassion" through (regular or metta) meditation and mindfulness.  This is similar to your ideas about using reason or cognitive power to (gradually) shape emotions.  I can speak from personal experience that the practice of meditation changed my view of others, but many (most) people  do not stick with the "program" long enough to realize change.<br/><br/>I have a similar way to describe personal, cognitive change.  People like to think that they use their will-power and intelligence to make decisions, but they are entirely unaware of the underlying biological process (that have been shaped by development, social influence...) that actually control their behavior.  My thought is related to models of behavior that sociologists and other researchers use.  I'll use an example of body weight (even though I have not studied this application)....<br/><br/>Here are some antecedents of maintaining a healthy body weight (although some might cause other problems): <br/>1) enjoyment of long-distance running<br/>2) willingness to forego TV time and idle time (or social time) to spend time walking, riding a bike, exercising, or doing other things to help maintain a healthy weight.<br/>3) making the time to replace driving with either walking or bicycling.<br/>4) willingness to acquire some relaxation skills so that one is able to use relaxation techniques to reduce the anxiety that is associated with mild hunger (this takes time to learn and practice the skills).<br/>5) willingness to avoid acquiring (family, social, volunteer, work..) obligations that would make it more difficult to spend time walking, exercising, or acquiring other skills that would help one to maintain a healthy weight (e.g., if you have 5 kids, 2 jobs, take night classes, and run a Dungeons and Dragon's club on the weekend, you won't have much time for a healthy daily routine).<br/>...<br/><br/>People who I know want to ignore all of the above and want to sit in a chair and channel their "will power" (that they do not develop).  The result is typically failure or development of eating disorders that are related to the extreme emotions related past and present situations.  To get back to the original point, sometimes changing your mind about one thing (e.g., "sticking to my diet") is best achieved as part of a long process of changing a series of little behaviors that are more easily controllable--those "antecedent behaviors" then contribute toward the original final outcome (e.g., health weight) as a byproduct of the causal antecedents of the outcome.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
