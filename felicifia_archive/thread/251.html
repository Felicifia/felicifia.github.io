If Oxford works at all similarly to courses in Melbourne, you've chosen philosophical and theological subjects within an Arts degree? How have you developed an interest in theology and does it guide your ethics? <br/><br/>Mika huh? yeah he's not bad.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">The background to my studies? How do you mean? Oxford must work differently to Melbourne, as the name of my degree is just "Philosophy and Theology" and I can't select options from other art subjects.<br/>I first started thinking properly about religion 4 or 5 years ago when my closest friends became christians. They were of the evangelical type so I spent a few years going to church with them, socialising mainly with Christians, having countless debates and chewing it all over. Studying theology was supposed to be a continuation of my thinking about the existence of God, but I've got to the point where I'm satisfied enough with atheism that I don't want to waste any more time and energy on theology (and it did take a lot out of me). So, no, it doesn't guide my ethics. In fact ethics is the main reason the traditional christian conception of God is so implausible, so in a way, ethics guides my theology <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/><br/>I wonder, have you ever met a religious utilitarian?<br/><br/>I also love the killers so it's not all shamelessly catchy pop music <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/> And I can only think of two male persons that I know who don't deeply dislike Mika so I don't expect any of you to share my taste there...</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">It sounds like you were studying theology when you became atheist. That would have been pretty annoying and inconvenient, right?

He was evangelising and delivering sermons all across America before finally making the switch... By the way, what caused you to finally turn atheist?<br/><br/>To answer your question about religious utilitarians, I don't know many. However, a visitor here adheres to Christianity on the basis of <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_Wager">Pascal's Wager</a>.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">To clarify a possible misunderstanding, I think the UK and Oz academic systems are actually quite different. In Oz, IIRC, you apply to study a (faculty name) degree, or sometimes a double degree in  (faculty name)+(other faculty name). Within each degree, you can pick any modules from the faculty you like and aren't necessarily obliged to do any particular ones, but are required to do over a certain %age in either one or two subjects - those then become your majors/major and minor.<br/><br/>The UK is more constrained - you apply to do a specific subject or pair of half-subjects at uni (we don't have any double-degree equivalent), and while you might be allowed some 'wild' modules, that subject is set (unless you switch degrees, as Lady Morgana is doing, and which is quite a hassle, and probably involves restarting) from before you ever show up on campus.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>If i recall correctly, it's Alan Darwst.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Yup.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Hello people, sorry it's been a while.<br/><br/>What caused me to finally turn atheist? Well, like Dan Barker, it was more of a gradual process than a sudden "lightning strike of reason". I went to Oxford agnostic and left as an atheist and I think two main things contributed to that. One was being able to discuss religion with people who weren't religious. Back home the only people I knew who wanted to talk about religion were religious, so I felt as though the burden of proof was on me and any atheist arguments had to be thoroughly justified, but just talking to atheists helped me to accept what I already thought was right (I was still discussing religion with Christians though, so it was balanced for the first time). The other thing was just spending a bit of time properly studying the Bible. So many people had given the evidence of the Bible as proof of the truth of Christianity, and I wanted to know what the experts' general view of the Bible was as opposed to the opinions of a group of recently-born-again-evangelicals-from-Worthing. I didn't come across a single theologian, including Christian theologians, who seemed anything close to accepting the Bible as the 'Word of God' ("yes, ok, it was written by man, but every man that wrote it was inspired by the Holy Spirit as he did so, so that he was really writing the word of God" is something I hear so often...when I ask how they know this they change the subject). Theologians treat the Bible the same as any other ancient document, for example, they never assume that political agendas of authors/scribes influencing the text is less likely just cos it's The Bible. Studying the Bible felt more like a combination of History and English than Theology.<br/><br/>I really like this( <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_Wager#God_rewards_belief">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_Wager#God_rewards_belief</a> ) response to Pascal's Wager.  <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/> There's a more entertaining version of it somewhere but I can't find it at the moment.<br/><br/>And, yes, men who dislike Mika disproportionately to other similar pop musicians are insecure about their sexuality.  <img alt=":D" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif"/>  There is usually some sneering comment about why he can sing so high and I suspect it is precisely for this reason. Arepo, this ( <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mikasounds.com/">http://www.mikasounds.com/</a> ) is what a Mika is...it is wonderful.<br/><br/>That 'On Homosexuality' article was shocking. "I contend moreover that there can be no genuine friendship and love between two homosexuals as between spouses"??? F*** off. That is my immediate and not-very-eloquently-put response to that!<br/><br/>And, Jesper, I like the sound of Butler. It’s rare enough to find a religious person who puts their own moral reasoning before God, but Richard Swinburne seems to fit this description. I was very pleasantly surprised by a talk he gave in Oxford recently – he was the first Christian I’d heard say that morality exists, regardless of whether or not God exists, and that Gods existence doesn’t change what is ultimately morally good.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Oddly enough I've recently given up on my plan to read the Bible - and started listening to the King James audio book <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/> I picked the KJV mainly on the grounds that it was translated by poets, but it frequently makes so little sense that I can't tell whether something in the translation is screwed up, whether the English language has changed more than I realised since it was translated, or if the passages in question really are just gibberish. <br/><br/>One recurring oddity is non-sequitur's relating to proper nouns, usually following 'therefore' - 'Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed', 'Therefore she called his name Judah' and the like. Maybe you can clarify this, LM?

But there's no obvious explanation around this passage, and this seems to be the first use of the word of 'Israel' in the bible. So I don't understand in what sense the explanation is supposed to explain anything.<br/><br/>What seems most likely to me (just going by the quote above) is that the word 'Israel' was a Hebrew word meaning something like 'prince' or 'powerful', but that because God was actually giving it as a name to Jacob (and presumably because people would have been familiar with the names in the Bible), the translators left the word alone, rather than translating it. But that's pure guesswork.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>That is correct. But I only studied it formally for a term (and informally philosophising about religion for about four years).
