<h3><a href="#p6066">Sam Harris (and Bentham, et al) missed a crucial next step</a></h3>
<p class="author"><img alt="Post" height="9" src="../styles/nexus/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" title="Post" width="11"/>by <strong><a href="../user/1075.html">GreatBigBore</a></strong> on 2012-07-27T00:23:00</p>
<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">A lot of people have said that Sam Harris is basically promoting Utilitarianism. It doesn't really matter to me what he is promoting, because standing on his (and Bentham's and everyone else's) shoulders, I think I can see a further step up, a step that could be hugely beneficial for us.<br/><br/>In his book "The Moral Landscape," Harris notes that the one common thread among all moral philosophies is the concern for the ongoing experience of conscious creatures. In other words, what really matters to all moral theories is whether creatures that can suffer or flourish are indeed suffering or flourishing. He points out that we could build a new morality where good and bad are determined by whether flourishing is caused or suffering is caused. I propose that we take it a step further and ditch good and bad entirely. I don't mean chaos in the streets. I mean maybe we should look at the facts a bit more carefully. I've argued in other forums that the entire framework of "should/ought" is fundamentally flawed, based on eons of grotesque rationalizations that our gigantic brains fabricated to explain each other's behavior, to explain the impulses we feel. I've gone so far as to assert that everything we currently call <span style="font-style: italic">morality</span> is literally a religion.<br/><br/>Harris suggests that we use suffering/flourishing as our moral guide. This, of course, sounds a lot like Utilitarianism, or maybe exactly like it. But what if we took one more step and sought to interpret the world based on hard facts rather than nebulous ideas of "good," "bad," "justice," "rights," etc., upon which no one will ever agree? I think this could solve a lot of huge problems we see in the world, and it doesn't require any fundamental change to human so-called nature. Let's agree amongst ourselves that what matters in the world is suffering/flourishing, not good/evil. Let's make laws geared toward preventing any person or group "A" from diminishing the flourishing of person or group "B." Let's look beyond these impulses that tell us that people "deserve" punishment when they "misbehave."<br/><br/>I think this gives us a foundation on which we could build something far more rational and applicable than any of the moral theories ever proposed. I really would love to hear any thoughts anyone might have on the matter.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

It makes so much sense that before too long, many people will subscribe to the idea. Then we can all start voting on changes to the law. We don't need everyone in the world to subscribe to the idea in order to start putting it into practice.

In principle, we can measure and quantify suffering and flourishing. It seems to me that with this simple tool we could see, probably for the first time in history, the ethical costs not only of passing our laws, but also the ethical costs of not passing them. We could completely redesign our framework in order to <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">balance</span></span> suffering. For example, the suffering experienced by those bereft of their family in a theater massacre as weighed against the suffering experienced by those who have a harder time buying military-grade munitions and explosives.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>peterhurford wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>GreatBigBore wrote:</cite>Let's look beyond these impulses that tell us that people "deserve" punishment when they "misbehave."</div></blockquote><br/>Definitely.

Ok he was writing before the metaethical wars of the 20th century (not to mention the turn-of-the-century breakthroughs in formal logic), so might have couched his ideas in less precise terms than we might, but as far as I remember he never detaches morality from the emotional states he thinks it entails.
