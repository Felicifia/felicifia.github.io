<p class="author"><img alt="Post" height="9" src="../styles/nexus/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" title="Post" width="11"/>by <strong><a href="../user/388.html">Pat</a></strong> on 2012-05-26T01:00:00</p>
<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">The Centre for Effective Altruism, the parent organization of 80,000 Hours and Giving What We Can, <a class="postlink" href="http://80000hours.org/causes/centre-for-effective-altruism">is accepting donations</a>:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>CEA is the charity that funds Giving What We Can and 80,000 Hours. Both of these organisations have carried out cost-effectiveness research which suggests that funding their campaigning activities produces significantly more money for Giving What We Can’s top recommended charities (or other highly effective charities) than giving to these charities directly. The management of CEA cares deeply about cost-effectiveness, and would not accept funding if they believe it could be spent significantly better elsewhere.</div></blockquote><br/>I have a couple of reservations about giving to the CEA even if it can leverage your money to produce large amounts in donations. The GWWC pledge requires that the donations benefit humans in developing countries. It's likely that most of the money donated by 80k members would go to developing-world charities as well. If you think that such donations aren't terribly cost-effective, it may be better to give to your favorite animal-welfare/x-risk/transhumanist charity.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I've been surprised at the extent to which 80k has been open to "out-there" charities. I'd have expected them to promote a more moderate image, at least at first. Maybe the CEA could steer donors toward other charities over the long-term.<br/><br/>The CEA doesn't have much of a track record, so it might be better to wait for a year or so to see how they handle the transition from volunteer to paid labor. On the other hand, you wouldn't want the CEA to founder for lack of funding, and because it's a small organization, one donor could make a significant difference.<br/><br/>The people behind GWWC and 80k are smart and want to make a big difference. That's true of a lot of organizations, I guess.<br/><br/>Here's <a class="postlink" href="http://www.givewell.org/researching-charities-on-your-own">what GiveWell says</a> are the most important factors in evaluating a charity:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>- A “bird's-eye view” of a charity's activities: all of its programs and locations, along with how much funding is going to each.<br/>- Meaningful and systematic (not anecdotal) evidence of impact.<br/>- Information about the likely impact of additional donations, including both plans for expansion and “funding gap” analysis (projections of how much a charity could productively spend, and how much current expected revenue falls short of this figure).<br/></div></blockquote><br/>What are your considerations for or against donating to the CEA?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">The CEA seems to be a better buy (perhaps many times better) than the Against Malaria Foundation, especially for those who believe that global poverty should is the most cost-effective cause. It may even generate more money for animal-welfare or existential-risk–reduction charities than giving directly to those charities would. Presumably, though, there's a limit on how much money the CEA can effectively absorb in the short-term. Beyond this point, it would be better to donate directly to the charities you want money to go to.<br/><br/>What's interesting is that this point is different for people who are committed to developing-world health than to those committed to other causes. This is because more of the donations generated by the CEA will go developing-world health than to other causes. So developing-world–health people should be willing to fund the CEA to a level higher than others would.<br/><br/>The CEA-funding issue sort of a game-theoretic situation because people who believe in different causes will want the CEA's funding to come out of other causes' budgets, not those of their own. So even if you want the CEA to be funded, it could be a game of chicken to see who will end up doing it. People who believe in more-marginal causes have the advantage because CEA donations are more cost-effective for those giving to developing-world health.<br/><br/>I guess the question then is, why aren't the developing-world healthers donating more to the CEA? I imagine that part of the problem is, ironically, due to one of the biases that the CEA is trying to expunge: that it's better to do good directly than indirectly.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I think the limit is relatively high, (in the sense that it's unlikely to matter to the median marginal funder) though. From a casual discussion with Will Crouch, he seemed to think they could easily get through £1 million, though I don't know how much experience they'd have in dealing with that large a lump sum in practice. That said, I've just written a long email arguing that the salaries they're offering are counterproductively low (I might post it as a blog post/series of blog posts though, in which case I'll try and remember to link it it from here - or I can forward it to anyone as is if they're interested), so I suspect they could do with even more than they think they can.<br/><br/>If my argument comes too late/doesn't persuade the relevant people, then we might end up in a position where those who think my argument is sound should specifically fund CEA <span style="font-style: italic">employees </span>rather than the org itself, which would be a bit weird...</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Even if the CEA decreed that a certain cause is the best one, I doubt whether most GWWC and 80k members would give exclusively to it. Members may agree that they want to do good, but they have differing views about what that means. As long as getting people to give more remains part of the CEA's mission, multiple causes will benefit.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>If you support their goal (and think they offer the best way of reaching it), then you should be willing to donate regardless of your disposition toward existing causes, since if your disposition is misguided you'll want it to be corrected.</div></blockquote><br/>That's an appealing argument. There's disagreement about what charities or causes to support, so we should instead pay for people to figure it out. <br/><br/>There are probably some constraints on the CEA's message. I doubt whether the CEA would promote the idea that promoting developing-world health is harmful or that existential risk is good. I don't know if those are true, I'm just saying. The charity-effectiveness research that GiveWell has done was a lot of work. If the scope of the research extends to include any cause, the difficulties are compounded. It's relatively easy to judge the effectiveness of health interventions. But what about about activities whose value lies chiefly in changing the likelihood of low-probability events many decades or centuries in the future? In addition, philosophical disagreements start to matter a lot. <br/><br/>A million dollars seems like a lot of money. If it is true that the CEA could use that much money effectively, the threshold beyond which it would be more effective to donate directly to the most effective causes would be unlikely to be surpassed.

By "effectively," I mean that giving to the CEA does more good than giving to any other charity.<br/><br/>The CEA will get a certain amount of money from people who would otherwise have donated to developing-world health, and it may receive money from foundations as well. If the CEA could spend only a small amount of money effectively, these sources could fund the CEA and there would be no need for me to contribute to it. I could instead donate to whatever cause I think is most effective.<br/><br/>If the CEA could spend a million dollars a year effectively, it is unlikely to obtain that level of funding. I guess the basic point I was trying to make was that it makes sense to give to the CEA only if it has <a class="postlink" href="http://givewell.org/international/technical/criteria/scalability">room for more funding</a>.<br/><br/>Of course, a charity's assertion that it can use a certain amount of money effectively might be interpreted as only weak evidence that it can actually do so.<br/><blockquote><div><cite>Alan Dawrst wrote:</cite>And why should people who favor obscure causes want to fund CEA more?

Maybe it's because they don't realize that the CEA is accepting donations, or because the CEA hasn't been vetted by an outside group, or because it doesn't have a track record of dealing with a substantial budget, or because donating to the CEA a step further removed from saving lives, or because of habit.<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>And in that last sentence I think you meant "increasing existential risk," although I wouldn't necessarily object to saying "decreasing."</div></blockquote><br/>I actually meant "decreasing." <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/> I meant that what I said earlier applies only if you believe that donations to causes other than the ones you're interested in have neutral value.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev hidden" data-snap="0">Hey,<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I'm Managing Director and co-founder of GWWC, and President and founder of 80k.  I'll try to write my personal view of the issue - inevitably though I'd expect to be ineliminably biased towards the organisations I've created.  So do bear that in mind.<br/><br/>1. I think that the arguments for donating on the margin to meta-charity in general are extremely strong.  The reason simply being that the rate of return one can get on charitable fundraising far outstrips that of private investment; and that effective altruism and optimal philanthropy seem to have particularly good rates of return (it's an idea whose time has come, but is not yet anywhere near saturation point).<br/><br/>GiveWell would be one such giving opportunity.  But they have no room for more funding.<br/><br/>This might also happen for GWWC or 80k.  Which is why, at the moment, we're primarily trying to find out how much people would be willing to donate, *conditional on us being able to spend the money well*.  If we hit our room for funding, we'd tell our donors.  But we're not yet confident even that we will be able to take on the people who we are desperate to hire.<br/><br/>I'll also clarify a couple of things:<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>CEA is the charity that funds Giving What We Can and 80,000 Hours.</div></blockquote> <br/><br/>I didn't actually know it was written like that on the website.  It's slightly misleading (and have asked for it to be changed).  CEA is the legally recognised charitable company that comprises GWWC and 80,000 hours.  But donations can go direct to GWWC or to 80k.<br/><br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>From a casual discussion with Will Crouch, he seemed to think they could easily get through £1 million</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I don't remember saying that.  I think that over the next year we could spend $190 000 very well (that's a safe estimate of 5 full-time staff, plus overheads (and perhaps some secretarial assistance)).  I wouldn't want to take on more than $250 000, as diminishing returns would really start to kick in quickly; unless we thought of a good way of spending money that wasn't staff.<br/><br/>Cause-dependence:<br/><br/>If global poverty alleviation, then GWWC.  My inside view opinion is that 80k will considerably outstrip GWWC in terms of cost-effectiveness.  But, once I take an outside view, and take overconfidence into account by considering that GWWC has a larger body of evidence behind it than 80k, and has had truly remarkable success so far, I reckon I can't stand by that view right now.  So I'd say that that the dollar in / expected dollar to global poverty out ratio is highest for GWWC.<br/><br/>If existential risk reduction, then 80k.  Of a sample of 27 members, 34% of pledged donations to existential risk mitigation.  Insofar as new effective altruists  tend to start off concerned about global poverty or animal suffering and then hear, take seriously, and often  are convinced by the arguments for existential risk mitigation, I'd expect the proportion to remain significant (20% or more).<br/><br/>If improving animal welfare is your thing (and only your thing), I really don't think I can recommend either.  Only a small proportion of 80k donations are pledged towards animal charities.  And there are rich meat eater worries related to donations to the developing world.  Though there might still be arguments in favour of 80k, I wouldn't think it a safe bet.<br/><br/>If you are highly uncertain, then 80k.  This is my personal position (and I've just written a paper (<a class="postlink" href="http://oxford.academia.edu/WilliamCrouch/Papers/1684300/Moral_Recklessness_and_Moral_Caution_Draft_">http://oxford.academia.edu/WilliamCrouch/Papers/1684300/Moral_Recklessness_and_Moral_Caution_Draft_</a>) on why you should be in this position too, and what to do if you are)! [Note for Alan, who won't buy the argument: you should be meta-ethically uncertain too!]  The reason being that I would expect the average cost-effectiveness of donations from the EA community as a whole (a bunch of very smart, well-motivated and well-informed people) to be at least as good as my personal best guess, and if I can get a huge return on my investment while more evidence comes in, then so much the better!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>- Track record.<br/><br/>If we were going to spend the money on something other than staff, I'd think that would be a major worry.  But the large majority of our expenditure will be on staff.  And, though we don't have a record of taking paid donations or hiring paid staff, we do have a record of having dedicated volunteers, working 20+ hours a week on the projects.  Full-time staff can only increase the efficiency of those hours, as there are quite a lot of inefficiencies in having to rely solely on volunteers: i) total person-hours are spread among a large number of people, and so communication is slower, and miscommunication easier;  ii) there is a greater management overhead; iii) there aren't the same incentive systems as with workers, and so tasks often are done slower and there is less guarantee of quality; iv) there's a high turnover as student volunteers move onto other things; and iv) there are sustainability worries as core volunteers (the directors and managers) find their time taken up with other things.  Taking paid staff also means that we can have more volunteers (as we've got more people to recruit and manage them), so you're not just buying 40+ hours a week; you're also buying substantial volunteer time on top of that.<br/><br/><br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Hmm, I was assuming that donating a dollar to the CEA could be expected to generate more than a dollar for each of a variety of causes. Even if the CEA decreed that a certain cause is the best one, I doubt whether most GWWC and 80k members would give exclusively to it.

Disclaimer: I'm Managing Director and co-founder of GWWC, and President and founder of 80k.  I'll try to write my personal view of the issue - inevitably though I'd expect to be ineliminably biased towards the organisations I've created.  So do bear that in mind.<br/>
<br/>
1. I think that the arguments for donating on the margin to meta-charity in general are extremely strong.  The reason simply being that the rate of return one can get on charitable fundraising far outstrips that of private investment; and that effective altruism and optimal philanthropy seem to have particularly good rates of return (it's an idea whose time has come, but is not yet anywhere near saturation point).<br/>
<br/>
GiveWell would be one such giving opportunity.  But they have no room for more funding.<br/>
<br/>
This might also happen for GWWC or 80k.  Which is why, at the moment, we're primarily trying to find out how much people would be willing to donate, *conditional on us being able to spend the money well*.  If we hit our room for funding, we'd tell our donors.  But we're not yet confident even that we will be able to take on the people who we are desperate to hire.<br/>
<br/>
I'll also clarify a couple of things:<br/>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>CEA is the charity that funds Giving What We Can and 80,000 Hours.</div></blockquote> <br/>
<br/>
I didn't actually know it was written like that on the website.  It's slightly misleading (and have asked for it to be changed).  CEA is the legally recognised charitable company that comprises GWWC and 80,000 hours.  But donations can go direct to GWWC or to 80k.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>From a casual discussion with Will Crouch, he seemed to think they could easily get through £1 million</div></blockquote>

I don't remember saying that.  I think that over the next year we could spend $190 000 very well (that's a safe estimate of 5 full-time staff, plus overheads (and perhaps some secretarial assistance)).  I wouldn't want to take on more than $250 000, as diminishing returns would really start to kick in quickly; unless we thought of a good way of spending money that wasn't staff.<br/>
<br/>
Cause-dependence:<br/>
<br/>
If global poverty alleviation, then GWWC.  My inside view opinion is that 80k will considerably outstrip GWWC in terms of cost-effectiveness.  But, once I take an outside view, and take overconfidence into account by considering that GWWC has a larger body of evidence behind it than 80k, and has had truly remarkable success so far, I reckon I can't stand by that view right now.  So I'd say that that the dollar in / expected dollar to global poverty out ratio is highest for GWWC.<br/>
<br/>
If existential risk reduction, then 80k.  Of a sample of 27 members, 34% of pledged donations to existential risk mitigation.  Insofar as new effective altruists  tend to start off concerned about global poverty or animal suffering and then hear, take seriously, and often  are convinced by the arguments for existential risk mitigation, I'd expect the proportion to remain significant (20% or more).<br/>
<br/>
If improving animal welfare is your thing (and only your thing), I really don't think I can recommend either.  Only a small proportion of 80k donations are pledged towards animal charities.  And there are rich meat eater worries related to donations to the developing world.  Though there might still be arguments in favour of 80k, I wouldn't think it a safe bet.<br/>
<br/>
If you are highly uncertain, then 80k.  This is my personal position (and I've just written a paper (<a class="postlink" href="http://oxford.academia.edu/WilliamCrouch/Papers/1684300/Moral_Recklessness_and_Moral_Caution_Draft_">http://oxford.academia.edu/WilliamCrouc ... ion_Draft_</a>) on why you should be in this position too, and what to do if you are)! [Note for Alan, who won't buy the argument: you should be meta-ethically uncertain too!]  The reason being that I would expect the average cost-effectiveness of donations from the EA community as a whole (a bunch of very smart, well-motivated and well-informed people) to be at least as good as my personal best guess, and if I can get a huge return on my investment while more evidence comes in, then so much the better!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Track record.<br/>
<br/>
If we were going to spend the money on something other than staff, I'd think that would be a major worry.  But the large majority of our expenditure will be on staff.  And, though we don't have a record of taking paid donations or hiring paid staff, we do have a record of having dedicated volunteers, working 20+ hours a week on the projects.  Full-time staff can only increase the efficiency of those hours, as there are quite a lot of inefficiencies in having to rely solely on volunteers: i) total person-hours are spread among a large number of people, and so communication is slower, and miscommunication easier;  ii) there is a greater management overhead; iii) there aren't the same incentive systems as with workers, and so tasks often are done slower and there is less guarantee of quality; iv) there's a high turnover as student volunteers move onto other things; and iv) there are sustainability worries as core volunteers (the directors and managers) find their time taken up with other things.  Taking paid staff also means that we can have more volunteers (as we've got more people to recruit and manage them), so you're not just buying 40+ hours a week; you're also buying substantial volunteer time on top of that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Hmm, I was assuming that donating a dollar to the CEA could be expected to generate more than a dollar for each of a variety of causes. Even if the CEA decreed that a certain cause is the best one, I doubt whether most GWWC and 80k members would give exclusively to it. Members may agree that they want to do good, but they have differing views about what that means. As long as getting people to give more remains part of the CEA's mission, multiple causes will benefit.</div></blockquote>

That's right.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Thanks for the paper, Will! I'm not especially confident in my current beliefs about ethics. With a few caveats, taking into account what informed people think is probably a good idea.<br/><br/>Here's an argument from the paper that we should work to reduce existential risk even if we are pretty sure extinction is a good thing:<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Broome argues that, because of the good arguments in favour of there only being one neutral level – that is, one level of wellbeing at which it is neither good nor bad for there to exist an additional person - human extinction would be either extremely bad (because the value of additional humans in the future would be positive, and because there would have been very many of them), or extremely good (because the value of additional humans in the future would be negative, and because there would have been very many of them). Let’s grant Broome those claims. Broome thinks that what follows from this is that it is unclear what we ought to do with respect to the risk of human extinction. <br/> <br/>In expected choice-worthiness terms, however, this isn’t correct. <span style="font-weight: bold">Provided that the decision-maker has choice over the matter at a later date</span>, current human extinction would be extremely bad, in terms of expected choice-worthiness, even if the high neutral level view were correct, such that the extinction of the human race would actually be a very good thing, and even if our current moral evidence points in that direction . <br/> <br/>The reasons for this are first because letting the human race go extinct is by its nature an irreversible decision, whereas preserving the human ra ce is not, and, second, because if we wait a few centuries before making such a decision, we will have better moral evidence at the time of the decision. This gives us an extremely strong reason in favour of delaying such a decision. <br/></div></blockquote><br/>It seems extremely unlikely to me that humanity will consciously decide to go extinct. If all the world's philosophers convene and put together a consensus statement that the continued existence of humanity is bad, the masses will have a good chuckle and then go back to watching reality TV. And if people did what philosophers told them to do, the world would be in less of a mess, and the survival of humanity would (it seems to me) offer substantially more upside than downside.<br/><br/>Reducing the risk of extinction beyond a certain point (e.g., by colonizing other space) will ensure humanity's survival nearly as much as extinction would ensure its demise. So I'm not sure that giving to 80k is the obvious path if you're uncertain, since I don't see donating to 80k as a way of buying more time for us to figure out whether extinction is good. Instead, donating would make sense only if you thought that reducing existential risk is a good thing. I'm not sure whether it is, but I haven't researched the matter much. There are both utopian and dystopian scenarios, and it's not clear to me which are more likely.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Maybe support for the last one is only in the tens/hundreds of millions if you go by people's actual feelings rather than stated dogma.<br/><br/>My main reason for rejecting these seemingly absurd beliefs is overconfidence and the feeling that "I just don't care about being uncertain on these things." That said, it could also be rational in some sense to ignore these possibilities. Entertaining alternate viewpoints carries some risk of adopting them contrary to one's present wishes, because the mind is leaky and hard to control. When you're very sure you don't want to change your mind on something, it makes sense not to change your mind on it. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/> It's really that simple. If the feeling that you don't want to revise your opinion is stronger than your feeling that you should listen to what a changed version of you would feel, then you don't have to revise your opinion.<br/><br/>The above argument applies for non-realist "failure of introspection" arguments. For the realism argument, the claim is that ignoring these possibilities is making an actual epistemic error rather than just picking how much you want to care about something. I guess my present stance is (a) mostly to say I still don't care enough and ignore it even if it's epistemically irrational but also (b) give a tiny sliver of credence that I'm wrong about the logic of realism and what it implies, but this has little practical impact on my conclusions. If I get pinned into a situation where it seems like I need to revise my views given the tiny probability that realism is true combined with a small update that it would require me to make, I may either make that update or else say I (irrationally) don't care enough.<br/><br/>William﻿: Do the philosophers of moral realism you cited claim (a) only that moral truths exist or also (b) that it's somehow _factually_ incorrect not to care about these moral truths? If it's just (a), then at least I can understand the claim, and I would simply choose not to care about moral truths. If it's (b), I can't understand what this even means, but because I do care a little bit about not being factually incorrect, I would care a little bit about the implications of realism, unless I chose to be irrational by rejecting those implications.</div>

<br/>
As far as the point about moral uncertainty, the most accurate way to explain my brain's reaction is the following (similar to what I said above).<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it might be that I'm mistaken about introspection and what I would come to believe upon thinking and learning more.<br/>
<br/>
There are many cases where I am genuinely curious to explore other ideas and give them some weight. For example:<br/>
* What types of computations are conscious?<br/>
* Should the badness of suffering depend on brain size?<br/>
* Can any amount of happiness outweigh a day in hell?<br/>
<br/>
However, there are many other cases where I'm not interested in giving weight to other views, and in fact, if my future self changed his mind on these matters, I would regard that as a failure of goal preservation rather than a triumph of enlightenment. For example:<br/>
* Safe homosexuality, masturbation, and incest are wrong.<br/>
* Organisms now matter more than organisms later.<br/>
* It's good to torture kids for eternity when they don't obey religious rules. (<a class="postlink" href="#p5516">viewtopic.php?t=614#p5516</a>)<br/>
Each of these beliefs is held by huge numbers (billions) of people worldwide. Maybe support for the last one is only in the tens/hundreds of millions if you go by people's actual feelings rather than stated dogma.<br/>
<br/>
My main reason for rejecting these seemingly absurd beliefs is overconfidence and the feeling that "I just don't care about being uncertain on these things." That said, it could also be rational in some sense to ignore these possibilities. Entertaining alternate viewpoints carries some risk of adopting them contrary to one's present wishes, because the mind is leaky and hard to control. When you're very sure you don't want to change your mind on something, it makes sense not to change your mind on it. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/> It's really that simple. If the feeling that you don't want to revise your opinion is stronger than your feeling that you should listen to what a changed version of you would feel, then you don't have to revise your opinion.<br/>
<br/>
The above argument applies for non-realist "failure of introspection" arguments. For the realism argument, the claim is that ignoring these possibilities is making an actual epistemic error rather than just picking how much you want to care about something. I guess my present stance is (a) mostly to say I still don't care enough and ignore it even if it's epistemically irrational but also (b) give a tiny sliver of credence that I'm wrong about the logic of realism and what it implies, but this has little practical impact on my conclusions. If I get pinned into a situation where it seems like I need to revise my views given the tiny probability that realism is true combined with a small update that it would require me to make, I may either make that update or else say I (irrationally) don't care enough.<br/>
<br/>
William﻿: Do the philosophers of moral realism you cited claim (a) only that moral truths exist or also (b) that it's somehow _factually_ incorrect not to care about these moral truths? If it's just (a), then at least I can understand the claim, and I would simply choose not to care about moral truths. If it's (b), I can't understand what this even means, but because I do care a little bit about not being factually incorrect, I would care a little bit about the implications of realism, unless I chose to be irrational by rejecting those implications.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Will addresses these arguments in section 7.2 (p. 25) with two responses.<br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>First, it seems to me reasonable to have a fairly small credence in such views (depending of course on one’s precise epistemic situation). The above views have little in the way of compelling argument supporting them: this is why there are few who do research in academic ethics who hold such views. If one thinks that academic ethicists are considerably more likely to have correct moral views than the average American, then one could quote reasonably give the above views low credence. Moreover, the reason why one might think that one should have something approaching a moderate credence in such views is because of the large proportion of people who hold such views. But the size of the group is only relevant to the evidential import of disagreement if one person’s judgment, within that group, is independent of the others’: that is, if one cannot predict the view of one person, within the group, merely on the basis of knowing that another person within the same group holds the same view. But the judgments of those who hold such views are not independent of each other, because the views held above are rarely held by those who are not religious, and belief in those views seems in general to be a direct effect of the religious belief. One’s credence that these views are correct should not be much greater, therefore , than one’s credence that the religious views that support them are correct. And it seems to me it would be reasonable to have very low credence in such thick religious views. <br/> <br/>Second, they are not issues on which there is no loss to not engaging in the purportedly immoral practice. According to any moral view on which increasing the amount of wellbeing in the world is morally important, it can be immoral not to engage in homosexual sex, or sex outside of marriage. And even on moral views for which there is no moral reason to increase one’s own wellbeing, there are still often strong prudential reasons for engaging in homosexual sex, or sex outside of marriage, or suicide. <br/></div></blockquote><br/>Against the first point, someone might argue that the difference between academic philosophers and religious fundamentalists might be smaller than it seems. But it seems quite reasonable to give more weight to the opinions of philosophers than to those of cavemen. I think you should give little weight to the opinions of somebody who hasn't heard an argument that is important to your position on a given issue. Less weight should be given to opinions that can be explained as the result of biases.<br/><br/>The second point might be vulnerable to Pascalian reasoning if you give any weight at all to the views of religious fundamentalists. Homosexual sex might be fun, but the small chance of its causing you to suffer for eternity would seem to outweigh any transient pleasure derived from it.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Indeed, since we know the religion is false and yet these values got attached to it, they must have already existed outside of the religion. Else where did they come from?<br/><br/>Maybe there are some behaviors that derive from a belief that a man in the sky is watching you that you wouldn't maintain otherwise (e.g., <a class="postlink" href="http://crolandcook.com/wordpress/?p=14">hangups about sex</a>: "These lesser males generally do not try to mate with females while a dominant male is watching because this would be a sure way to get beat up.")

I don't have time to learn much philosophy, science, or other relevant information, so it's easier to just survey a field and average the beliefs of experts. Some people say "Experts? Bah!

Can 7 billion other people do the same?<br/><br/>I think there are examples of greenhouses that grow plant-based food industrially without chopping up animals. Furthermore, they may replace wild animal populations who would otherwise be chopped up by predators frequently. I don't know enough about the science of agriculture to conclude whether there are ways to solve these problems sustainably and reliably on a large scale. I do think it's good to raise the topic, but there should be a broader social discussion instead of do-it-yourself solutions - unless you can use them as a proof of concept that can be brought into the discussion and adopted by the rest of the world, never ignoring, of course, the economic realities of the food industries. In other words, it has to be cheap and scalable enough.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Ah, now I see (given the context). Seems like a good point. I guess many non-utilitarian positions might allow you to kill to survive, but I'm not sure whether they allow killing such numbers. Also, I guess most individual people involved here could survive (even if not all humanity could do it) without using such agro methods.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">But on the other hand Will Crouch also says that we should also give moderate credence to the view that we have strong duties to benefit, and growing all your own food probably involves sacrificing opportunities to benefit sentient beings in other ways, so it looks like there is a conflict here.
