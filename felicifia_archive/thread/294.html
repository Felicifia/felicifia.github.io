<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">WeAreNow, it boils down to the concept of expected value being more useful to consequentialists than actual results. Expected value is essentially value of the event you're considering multiplied by the probability of it happening in the circumstances under discussion.<br/><br/>For example, if 1 cow constituted on average 10 human meals, then for every 10 extra humans who ate a burger, you would expect an extra sheep to be killed. So odds are actually 10-to-1 against, that if you order 1 burger, you'll actually necessitate an extra cow being killed.<br/><br/>So the expected (negative) value of you eating a burger would be 1/10th of a cow's life. That's going to remain roughly the same whether 100 or 1,000,000 other people happen to eat burgers that day too. (although obviously I've just made up the actual numbers for this example)</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Another answer is this:<br/><br/>To promote veganism is an excellent way in which many people are introduced to the topic of animal suffering and many people become animal rights activists. It's necessary a general concern for animal suffering if we want to reduce animal suffering (including suffering of wild animals).<br/><br/><br/>(But veganism isn't enough.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">yeah it'll hardly surprise you all that I think being vegan does make a difference. When you reduce your consumption of animal products, it reduces the value of animal products and the supply of animal products. If animal products are produced in batches, it doesn't matter. At a very superficial level, it might be said that you're unlikely to stop a batch of 100 eggs from being produced. However, you are making this batch less likely to be produced. A 1% chance of preventing 100 eggs from being produced is equivalent to a 100% chance of 1 particular egg from being produced. So whether eggs are produced individually or in large batches, turning vegan makes a difference. <br/><br/>The same argument applies for vegatarianism <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Now, hummus and pita bread, that's so common that's almost mainstream.  So maybe something a little more exotic that nonvegetarians may develop a taste for it.  Run it past the host(ess) first.  Hopefully, he or she will view it as you helping with the event.  Although in the last minute push with the flurry of tasks, I'm sure you'll understand that this is not necessarily a given!

Try this: "If one person [out of a substantially large group] doesn't eat the meat, there is no effect [on the "host's" perception]." i.e., the difference between 1000 and 1001 patties is not the same as between 0 and 1 patties.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">WeAreNow, thanks for continuing the good conversation. You're right about the difference in perception between 0 and 1 vs. 1000 and 1001. However, I still have an intuition that the expected impact of refraining from consumption is the same in each case. People who purchase for events may make substantial errors in estimation, but I would guess that the average percent error from truth is roughly constant -- people don't, on balance, make bigger and bigger percent errors for larger and larger crowds. So to the extent that the estimated amount continues to track the true amount, your action still has the same expected impact (even if your odds of impact are much smaller).<br/><br/>In fact, if we assumed that people overestimate <span style="font-style: italic">more</span> for larger crowd sizes, then it would be even better to avoid consumption for large events. For example, if (expected amount purchased) = 1.2 * (amount consumed on previous occasions), then by refraining from eating one chicken on a previous occasion, you prevent the purchase of an expected 1.2 chickens next time!<br/><br/>Beyond this, I do think that the social conversation provoked by your demonstration of vegetarianism has far more impact than these individual purchases. We are primates who learn much of our behavior through imitation. Hopefully, people will see your example and consider vegetarianism as a serious option that sane people might choose. In this case, not being too strict (e.g., not minding butter or cheese) could be a plus, to the extent that it shows that you don't have to go to extremes to reduce animal suffering through food choice.

It seems like it would take 20 vegetarians to make a difference. This would be true if they prepared enough for 100 people. That seems like a reasonable assumption, but it isn't. If last time, they only made enough for 90, they wouldn't have noticed. Because of this, it isn't stable until it gets outside the 80 to 120 range. As such, it will be quite common that you make an effect, even if you're the only vegetarian.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

For example, I used to be into perfectionism, not so much anymore (thank goodness!).  This, combined with medium disclosure.  And then, if the person responds in a positive way, you can disclose more.  If they don't, you don't have to.<br/><br/>This instead of trying to play the person like you might a fellow player in a Texas Hold'em poker game.  Now, I know the original writer is not saying this.  But so much formal writing in philosphy, maybe because of an emphasis on precision, by implication often treats other people as some kind of counters or holders of belief.  We're trying to look three levels deep into social interaction.  Okay, I suppose that is part of being a good coach or a good boss.  But you've got to be ready if the person takes it in a different direction and respect them as a human being.

Eating meat that's just being put in the fridge for another day seems much the same as eating it just after it's been cooked, but there are two (or more) sides to the coin. We get surprisingly fixated on the boundaries of plates.<br/><br/>Eating meat that's going to be thrown away seems basically harmless. Sure it *might* have the obscure and low-probability negative effects people like to point out when I mention this, but it might also be an important source of Vit B12 for you, plus it has an obvious economic benefit to you.<br/><br/>What's interesting is when you go out for a meal with an omnivorous friend. Typically you, the veggie, will order a veggie dish and he’ll order something with meat (say) 2/3 of the time. Once that’s done, you would typically eat what you’ve ordered – even though it seems much the same outcome if you share both dishes between you.<br/><br/>Another scenario that rarely comes up is that your friend decides whether he would like to eat a meat dish. Having announced that he would, he eschews the option, and buys a vegetarian dish on your behalf, while you buy something with meat it. Clearly in this case it’s a worse outcome than if he had eschewed the option and you’d gone veggie anyway, but just as good as a ‘normal’ vegetarian/omnivore pairing. Also, your friend might only do this on the expectation that he’d get *some* of your dish, so the possibility of two veggie dishes is less than 2/3 anyway. He might also be offering it more from a sense of your benefit than the animal’s – ie. he knows you like meat and is willing to put himself out so you can have some, but not willing to put himself out if you’re just going to have vegetarian food anyway.<br/><br/>The last scenario is tricky and probably involves a bit of game theory, but both of the scenarios make being vegetarian easier. Some people would claim (and have, indignantly, claimed) that following this logic means you’re not really a vegetarian. While that doesn’t seem like a very interesting criticism to me, it does make me feel that it would help to come up with a separate label for this kind of pragmatic vegetarianism (especially since a lot of people seem to think of vegetarianism as such a large leap from where they are now that they assume I won’t eat food if it’s been touched by tongs used for meat). It effectively distributes some of the burden of vegetarianism from people to their friends, in a slightly better than zero sum kind of way, since if it makes being veggie slightly easier you’d expect more people to become it, and the less people you see eating meat, the easier it becomes to not do so yourself.<br/><br/>So, thoughts on labels? If we come up with a good one, it might be a nice entry for the Wiki to point people who think being veggie is too hard to.<br/><br/>There’s another downside to this kind of reasoning, though. Sometimes you’ll get a gratis vegetarian side dish. Typically you’d share this if you both had room/expected to have room after your main meal. But just because it’s meat doesn’t mean this differs from your example – if you leave this to your friend, he’s likely to eat less, you’re likely to eat more, which is a better outcome given that he sometimes eats meat. But using the same logic, once you’ve paid for your meal, assuming your friend has any interest in it at all, you do best to give every scrap of food you’ve ordered to him and then feed yourself later. <br/><br/>One counter to this is the same meta-argument in reverse – that it would make being a veggie much harder and strongly disincentivise people from it. Another is that if your friend eats a load of food at once it’ll be much less efficient than spreading the same calories between two people. I guess the latter is the main one – while you might give him some of your food, it becomes pointless beyond a certain point.<br/><br/>(was distracted repeatedly while writing this - apologies for the rambling nature)</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2">Fortunately not all aspects of veganism lead to an overall increase of animal life years. It seems to only be the case for larger animals like pigs and cows. According to this paper (page 586), chicken farming increases animal life years: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.qalys.org/animal-welfare.pdf">http://www.qalys.org/animal-welfare.pdf</a> <br/>And according to Brian's estimates, eating wild-caught fish leads to an increase of smaller fish, which would mean more animal life years in the wild: <a class="postlink-local" href="../thread/455.html">viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;t=455</a><br/>And fish farming is the worst practice in terms of suffering anyway: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-per-kg.html">http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-per-kg.html</a><br/> <br/>Ignoring all the effects of personal veganism on other people, it seems that, while veganism is not the optimal way to reduce animal suffering, it's probably still better than the average lifestyle (mainly because people eat a lot of chicken and fish). <br/><br/>Eating pigs and cows appears to be better still, but cows increase global warming, and that may again lead to an overall increase of wild animals: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/veg-and-wild-animals.html">http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/veg-a ... imals.html</a><br/><br/>Pork (or lamb?) seems like the best choice in that regard then. But it's unhealthy and, at least for me, not as tasty as other animal products. <br/><br/>There is obviously a lot of empirical uncertainty here. Let's suppose that the trend shifts away from factory farming and more towards sustainable ways of using land, which will increase the effect of decreasing the numbers of wild animals. Would veganism then lose out? <br/><br/>As I see it, spreading the right memes is extremely important. And I don't see how one would try to introduce a mainly deontological public to anti-speciesism if one supports large-scale farming practices. Even if veganism paradoxically increases animal suffering in the short term, the change of attitudes seems important enough to make up for it in the future. I don't see a better way to make this happen. A big caveat is that veganism would have to be thoroughly anti-speciesist and not coupled with deep ecology or similar views. That's why it might not be a good idea to use environmental arguments for the promotion of veganism, even though the trade-off becomes complicated here. <br/>The issue of wild animal suffering is important for people who already care about animal rights. That's another strong reason for utiltiarians to be vegan: If you're not, you lose nearly all credibility in the eyes on animal rights people. And we need them as allies when it comes to wild animal suffering. <br/><br/>As a vegan I'm biased here, but overall, I'm convinced that veganism is the best way to go. I'm curious what others here think about this though!</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I'm sure that you aren't picking on me. Your comment is very interesting.<br/><br/>If veganism increases the number of living animals and there is a net negative well-being in the wild, then veganism would be increasing wild-animal suffering. On the other hand, veganism reduces the number of farmed animals, so it reduces domestic-animal suffering. I don't know what is the global balance.<br/><br/>But even if veganism promotes more suffering (at least initially), I think it has a positive impact, because it produces a change in people's general concerns. There are several people that have wild-animal suffering into account (mainly utilitarians), but I think it's very hard for most speciesist people that we must reduce wild-animal suffering.<br/><br/>Could we fight speciesism without a vegan message? I think it's nearly impossible. Veganism is a good rule of thumb if we want to increase moral consideration for animals. The most involved people that I know defending all the animals (including wild animals) are vegan. I think it's very difficult for a non-vegan to support a charity with the goal of reducing wild-animal suffering.<br/><br/>I think there would be a <span style="font-style: italic">good veganism</span> and a <span style="font-style: italic">bad veganism</span>:<br/>- Good veganism: consequentialist, anti-environmentalist, anti-speciesist, non-political, education-centered...<br/>- Bad veganism: rightist, environmentalist, non anti-speciesist ("just vegan"), political...<br/><br/>I know this a tricky issue, but I think an alternative is needed if someone rejects veganism.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2">Thanks for the replies. Daniel, I guess the alternative approach would be to try to directly change people's attitudes towards wild animal suffering rather than arguing that veganism has to be an indirect, intervening step. All else being equal, a direct intervention should be more effective than one that requires indirect steps, although you could argue all else isn't equal here. A benefit of the direct approach is that it might not elicit defensiveness in meat-eaters. Alternatively, though, if we could ever get mainstream animal rights, pro-vegan organizations to discuss issues about wild animal suffering, then we could reach a much bigger, possibly receptive audience. Imagine if such organizations show attention-grabbing factory farming videos and then viewers go to those organizations' webistes and the websites have links discussing wild animal suffering. I'd add that if we do decide that there is net suffering in nature and that reducing the amount of nature or wilderness is a good thing, there are probably much more effective ways to do so than to build factory farms. Still, I think extendedcircle is right that there's a lot of uncertainty in the calculations at this point.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

The impact of factory farming on the population of animals that reproduce using r-selection is much more pertinent.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2">Hello, I am new too but this question is of great interest to me.  <br/><br/>As others have pointed out, the boycott aspect is not entirely useless.  But I think that the main way that an individual's veganism is useful is that it makes it easier for others to transition to veganism or at least reduced animal consumption, through multiple routes:<br/><br/>In addition to the boycott of animal foods, vegans tend to purchase items that are distinctly vegan, such as non-dairy milks, veggie burgers, and so on.  It is an incredible success that mainstream grocery stores now carry a wide variety of non-dairy milks, not just soy, and this makes being vegan far more realistic for most people.  Buying these products ensures that grocery stores continue to stock them, helps restaurants consider adding more vegan options to their menu (especially since we have a reputation for dictating where the entire group goes to dinner!), and encourages the invention and advertising of new, tastier, cheaper vegan options.  <br/><br/>Being vegan starts conversation, which allows us to dispel misinformation that may be preventing others from reducing their animal consumption.  Also, every individual breaks at least some of the stereotypes, which can remind others that veganism can "happen" to anyone, that (almost) nobody was born vegan.  Furthermore, very many people are not yet aware or convinced that vegan is healthy, so being vegan lets us set an example that it is, that a vegan world would work just fine.<br/><br/>At least once in a while, many of us tend to cook vegan meals for others, which reduces (slightly) more animal consumption, but more importantly, may turn them on to new non-animal foods they never would have tried.  <br/><br/>All in all, I think that even if the boycott aspect is not convincing, the many ways that being vegan helps others reduce their animal consumption are more than enough reason for an individual to be vegan.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

However, <span style="font-weight: bold">in total aggregation</span>, I agree with you guys that suffering is exceedingly likely to be greatest in the wild.<br/><br/>However, I do have a lot of skepticism regarding what to do about wild animal suffering.  I tend to be on the skeptical side of sentience.  I want to weight organisms on their capacity to suffer, but I really don't think non-vertebrates suffer that much, if at all.  Thus, I would but heads against <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-per-kg.html">Brian's suffering-per-kg</a>.<br/><br/>To be careful, I place very high value of information regarding the capacity of pain for non-human animals, and would want to investigate the issue as fully as I can before I make my next charity donation.  Do you guys (especially Brian) have any data that would help in forming answers to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-per-kg.html">Brian's columns 5 and 6</a>?  Especially for animals that occur in the wild?<br/><br/>Lastly, I have a lot of skepticism for things we can do to decrease wild animal suffering.  As I mentioned earlier, it strikes me as a lot in common with Pascal's Mugging.  I tend to have objections to "very large utility / very small probability" estimations of expected utility when the numerator and denominator are both highly uncertain, and the problem is exceedingly poorly understood.  I have the same problem with existential risk.<br/><br/>~<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>As regards what cause one should work for it's worth considering how soon one expects in-vitro meat to come along.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Definitely.

They haven't been sanctioned by an official committee or anything. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/><br/><br/>You could multiply the painfulness of a day of life for factory-farmed animals by some factor (say, 1/3?) to get the number for wild animals. Or you could even conservatively take the day-to-day life of wild animals to be hedonically neutral. Either way, you're going to end up with massive suffering in the process of death alone, because most species give birth to hundreds or tens of thousands of offspring, only two of which can survive on average. Granted, not all of babies are sentient when they die, but a nontrivial fraction probably are. There's more discussion of this in "<a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-nature.html">The Importance of Wild-Animal Suffering</a>."<br/><br/>I would guess that <span style="font-style: italic">death</span> in the wild is at least as painful per animal as on factory farms, because farms in the industrialized world usually make at least an attempt to stun the animals in some fashion. (Of course, the stunning systems break down, and even when they work they may work badly, but it's probably better than nothing.) Compared with slaughter on factory farms, I expect slaughter in the developing world may be generally less humane, and slaughter in the wild <a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeuN7YAvdwc">is downright atrocious</a>.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>peterhurford wrote:</cite>I tend to have objections to "very large utility / very small probability" estimations of expected utility when the numerator and denominator are both highly uncertain, and the problem is exceedingly poorly understood.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>I'm not turned off by these scenarios.

But I've heard estimates like 10-15 years for chicken-nugget-style meat and maybe twice that for full steaks.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="3"><blockquote><div><cite>peterhurford wrote:</cite><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Care to comment more on this? I think most of us agree that most of the worlds suffering occurs in the wild so it would be very interesting if you are arguing the opposite?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Oh, I wasn't very clear, sorry.<br/><br/>When I said more suffering takes place in factory farms than in the wild, I meant to say  <span style="font-weight: bold">per organism</span> -- I think an individual organism suffers much more in a factory farm than the same animal would in the wild.  However, <span style="font-weight: bold">in total aggregation</span>, I agree with you guys that suffering is exceedingly likely to be greatest in the wild.<br/><br/>However, I do have a lot of skepticism regarding what to do about wild animal suffering.  I tend to be on the skeptical side of sentience.  I want to weight organisms on their capacity to suffer, but I really don't think non-vertebrates suffer that much, if at all.  Thus, I would but heads against <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-per-kg.html">Brian's suffering-per-kg</a>.<br/><br/>To be careful, I place very high value of information regarding the capacity of pain for non-human animals, and would want to investigate the issue as fully as I can before I make my next charity donation.  Do you guys (especially Brian) have any data that would help in forming answers to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-per-kg.html">Brian's columns 5 and 6</a>?  Especially for animals that occur in the wild?<br/><br/>Lastly, I have a lot of skepticism for things we can do to decrease wild animal suffering.  As I mentioned earlier, it strikes me as a lot in common with Pascal's Mugging.  I tend to have objections to "very large utility / very small probability" estimations of expected utility when the numerator and denominator are both highly uncertain, and the problem is exceedingly poorly understood.  I have the same problem with existential risk.<br/><br/>~<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>As regards what cause one should work for it's worth considering how soon one expects in-vitro meat to come along.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Definitely.  I admit that I have a pretty poor understanding of IV-meat, though.  Is it supposed to be indistinguishable from real meat?  If not, why would it experience more popularity than already existing meat substitutes?  Is there any data needed to calibrate an expectation of when the research would come out, and how long it would take to reach massive acceptance?</div></blockquote><br/>There's a wide range of actions that can be taken to decrease wild animal suffering - some of which don't warrant much skepticism. For example, placing a water bowl outside daily for animals on very hot days is quite feasible. Increasing funding for wildlife rehabilitation is also feasible. Much grander ideas require more research, though.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

We need to understand animal sentience, map the types of suffering and pleasure in wildlife, understand the consequences of habitat intervention or (realistically mostly) destruction for human economies and civilization, and find out how to convince people that their pro-nature view was wrong ethically (or be convinced by them that we are wrong about the suffering surplus or the consequences).<br/><br/>What other research did you have in mind?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

The point is discussed on both pages of <a class="postlink" href="../thread/493.html">the original thread</a>, but a quick summary is in this quote: "An exception is if you think that a significant amount of the resistance to giving animals ethical consideration is the fact that people don't want to give up eating them. A technological fix might allow people to realize the barbarity of their previous attitudes toward factory-farmed livestock, similarly to the way in which the industrial revolution made it easier for people to see the barbarity of slavery."<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Hedonic Treader wrote:</cite>Doesn't that increase the number of wild animals living net-negative lives?<br/></div></blockquote><br/>I was wondering the same.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Hedonic Treader wrote:</cite>What other research did you have in mind?<br/></div></blockquote><br/>IMO, it is both more important and an easier sell to persuade people that life in the wild is bad enough that we have an ethical obligation to avoid spreading it further (into space, in simulations, etc.). This could matter orders of magnitude more than the tragic suffering now on Earth. That said, spreading awareness of animal suffering on Earth is one important part of this strategy, so talking about suffering here and now isn't irrelevant; it's just that interventions specific to Earth may not be crucial.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

And one thing to remember is that even if technological advances make a former atrocity inefficient, that's not always enough: in the 1800's slavery was becoming less of an efficient process, but it still took a war to convince an entire society to change the way they operated, and another hundred fifty years on top of that to convince the society to really change their opinions towards blacks, and it seems likely to me that it was not entirely an economically fueled change: that people's conscience helped lead to the changes, and that in particular the work of people to turn the resistance to (slavery/discrimination) from a pet project of some liberals to the cultural norm.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="3">Also, something that's worth keeping in mind when e.g. deciding whether it's moral to eat meat is that just the act of being vegan helps to convince other people to give a shit about animal suffering, which in the long term is very important.
