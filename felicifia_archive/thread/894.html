<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">(A french friend read my post, and it’s appear that i did a lot of error, and some sentence are maybe completely incomprehensible, sorry for that, i will take time to do something better when i will have the time.)<br/><br/>I think we should change our political (and then economical) system profoundly, because they are inefficient in a utilitarian point of view for many reasons, here i will try to focus briefly about economy:<br/>before beginning i would say that i advocate bottom-up establishment of entirely new system, both for avoid violence, and test the systems in small scale before progressively augment the scale and upgrade.<br/><br/>I think we should abandon private property, because this lead to free market, or coercion, coercion is difficult to justifies on a deontological point of view (and then, are mostly instable and conflicts generator) and are mostly makeshifts that does not address the causes.<br/>The mains problems of this that i see are:<br/>- Necessity to sell (that lead to discard product, pub, programed obsolesce, limited sharing of knowledge …).<br/>- All the social problems about inequality, and dangerous power of big company and their lobbying.<br/>- Necessity to protect our personal property, and then a big curb on pooling.(we have empty houses and homeless).<br/>- A big maintained desire to obtain private property, and a more strong desire for money, that lead to corruptions and crimes.<br/><br/>The base for private property, are much weaker that the base for liberalism when private property are accepted. <br/>By example libertarians should not accept private property, because it’s a big coercion (this constrain all mens to not use all the things that are become the property of others, even if by example he have no way to eat otherwise and he is starving, and we can even have intellectual property !). But private property accepted, libertarians and liberals are very near.<br/><br/>If we don’t have private property, we will nevertheless need rules for know who can consume/use what, and when.<br/>Then we have coercion again, but less strong, and better we have a much more flexible framework than with the private property principle.<br/><br/>My proposition here, is that each people save its personals preferences, for all meaningful use/consumption he would have, and its preferences for all meaningful works he accept to do and could.<br/>Then we calculate how the repartition of works and right to use, maximize a certain utility function.<br/><br/>By doing so:<br/>- We don’t have necessity to sell<br/>- We have much less inequality and concentrated power<br/>- We don’t have unallocated resource that nobody use (because proprietary don’t use it, but want to keep it for latter)<br/>Symmetrically we don’t have unallocated labor force (unemployment).<br/>- There is no money, then we have a very strong damageable desire in less.<br/><br/>I know there are surely also many downsides, but i think it’s worth to sharing the idea, in fact we are a small community trying to build a system like this. (but for the moment all our work is in french).<br/><br/>I will stop here and read what you think of this, now that the mains ideas are explained.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">This is one of the many difficulties, first our utility function is lexical utilitarism, even if we aren’t lexical utilitarism (in fact i am, but only me), this work well for these case.<br/>Then if someone don’t work, they don’t get negative point, and because other get it, they will get little consumption.<br/>Also for not being able to work at all (even doing the more simple things), you have to be physically or mentally ill, and if you do a work, there are great chance that you want to do a job that you like.<br/><br/>Also capitalism is not about giving more at people who are more productive, (above all if you count productivity like the maximization of a "greater good"):<br/>- If you inherit and are rich, you can not work at all, and get many of the resources.<br/>- If you work hard and are very productive, but work for someone, you can have a low salary, else you can have a low salary because you don’t know how to sell your works.<br/>-You can create inutile frustrations for selling things, be productive at the harm of collective resources, or scam for earn money, ie, you could get money by being harmful of the greater good in the rule of capitalism, the bad thing is that people with less concern for greater good, will have less constraints in the competition for selling things.<br/><br/>Also even with that, in the system that i propose, you don’t have things that you want to sell (for being able to buy), you don’t have money that some people strongly want to get, and you don’t have a right of use things for a infinite duration, then there are many differences with capitalism.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>We have less coercion because with private property you have coercion for preventing someone to use something even if nobody else use it</div></blockquote><br/>Right, of course the inforcement of property rights is a form of coercion. But the institution of property rights themselves are a coordination principle that track preferences and provide incentives to be productive.<br/><br/>You can't replace that with central planning, even if you call it different names, such as "calculus" or "utility function". It's still central planning. Someone has to do the calculating, and someone has to define the utility function, and so on.<br/><br/>With property rights and consent-based markets, you get the matching between preferences and incentives to meet those preferences. It's a bottom-up process rather than a top-down process.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I think people will don’t leave because of all the social and economical shared advantage of this system.</div></blockquote>People don't follow the shared advantage of society, they follow their individual incentives. Most people care far more about themselves and their families and close friends than about any other person in society. Otherwise you'd see far more donations, and socialistic systems of the past would have worked far better.<br/><br/>If you could literally change human nature (genetically engineer the perfect altruist), and build a society of only those could work. But human nature is given, and any real system has to recognize that.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Sophia Lamb wrote:</cite><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QZb6SuZFc">Utopia cannot precede the Utopian.</a></div></blockquote></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

As long as you stay within the rules, the only way to help yourself is to help others.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Some men in government generally does a good job until they have a strong incentive to let you break the rules, this is what corruption is about.<br/>The power giving by private property and money undermine its own rules.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>DanielLC wrote:</cite>It relies on egoists. Sadistic people will manage to make it bad for other people, but very few people are willing to pay a price to hurt others.<br/></div></blockquote><br/><br/>You can relies on egoism only if you are certain that in your system, people can’t get more by doing bad things, and that egoists will not get the power to break the rules of the system.<br/>Also i think you are optimist about sadism.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>DanielLC wrote:</cite>I mean that it will arise on its own if you don't try to do anything to the system.

Is there a country that doesn't use capitalism, and succeeds because of it?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I don’t have evidences, i think this, because its seem improbable to me that we get the best possible system in a first try (especially in such a complex context), and i see many bad consequences of capitalism.<br/>Then yes, my "evidently" was too much.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
