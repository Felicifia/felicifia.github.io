<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">To my mind, the unspeakable filth of sexuality is axiomatic. I am convinced that it is inherently wicked. It causes unimaginable, unbelievable, pervasive misery: from mild sexual frustration to rape-murder, it is (except bereavement) possibly the greatest cause of human emotional suffering. The question is what to do. (Note that this essay concerns humans exclusively.)<br/><br/>1. Is sexuality intrinsically bad?<br/><br/>Yes. I take it as axiomatic, again, that sexuality is bad independently of happiness and suffering. I do not know how to convince a skeptic, as with optimism versus pessimism. But even on wholly utilitarian grounds, sexuality is probably bad. As with opiates, the initial 'joy of sex' of youth fades, and sexuality becomes a chore - engaged in to satiate one's desires more than for pleasure.  Moreover, on a negative utilitarian view, if the pleasure from sex is, say, 2n, and the suffering is n, it is still desirable to eliminate it.<br/><br/>2. What sexual actions are worst?<br/><br/>I believe that there are two dimensions of sexual evil. The first is utilitarian, the second is intrinsic. The second dimension concerns sexual conservatism or Puritanism, or that part of the evil of sexuality which is dissociable from the consequent suffering. In my mind, the least objectionable sexual practices on the second dimension are marriage-bed, missionary-position-type activities, and there is a gradient of abnormality and revulsion that includes masturbation, contraception, pornography, etc. The first dimension includes the consequent misery of sexual activity, encompassing sexual frustration, unrequited love, broken-heartedness, sexually transmitted disease, rape, etc. In my mind, the position of sexual activity on the first gradient is more important than the position on the second gradient. Therefore, the least objectionable sexual activities are those that involve little harm, including, say, masturbation - that is, activities that have little affective element. Of course, activities of this type generally include moderate wickedness on the second dimension.<br/><br/>3. What to do?<br/><br/>The 'final solution to the sexuality problem', of course, is eugenics (as for most other problems): that is, to use germ-line screening or 'designer genomes' to abolish this filthy aberration forever. Classical eugenic measures, such as to offer fecund parents money to be sterilized, are rather weaker, since they focus only on the extreme right tail of the sexuality bell curve. In the interim, a good technique is to provide immense amounts of pornographic material, as the Japanese do. Among young Japanese men, about one third claim that they are uninterested in sexual relationships, in part because their sexual desires are satiated by pornography. However, one runs the risk of producing extremely deviant, fetishistic material, as the Japanese have done (i.e., material that is wicked on the second gradient of sexual wickedness). A good solution to this problem is Orwellian in the most literal sense of the term: pornography is state-produced, available for a small cost, and any pornographic material from the private sector is punishable by life imprisonment, death, sterilization, exile, or other drastic measures. If one is a social conservative and wishes to focus on the second gradient of sexual wickedness (deviance), than one may instead try to ban contraception, pornography, etc. Thus 'liberal Augustinianism': the view that, while sexuality is wicked, its wickedness as a cause of suffering trumps its wickedness in itself.<br/><br/>One problem with the Japanese solution is that East Asians as a whole may be very K-selected. The notion that human races are r- or K-selected to varying degrees was originated by J. Philippe Rushton, and recently has been refined by a number of researchers. High K-selection indicates low sexual desire. Therefore, the pornography solution may not work. But it is worthy of investigation.<br/><br/>Elijah Armstrong<br/>2013</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Hi Elijah,<br/><br/>Thanks for that interesting essay. Normally, it's said to be a sign of "modern" people to be open-minded to all kinds of sexuality. Although I am neither a conservative nor an adherent of a specific religion, I have my moral problems with sexuality but they sometimes differ from yours.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Yes. I take it as axiomatic, again, that sexuality is bad independently of happiness and suffering.</div></blockquote><br/>Wow! That's really tough! I wouldn't claim that myself because I couldn't prove it but sometimes I feel alike because sexuality causes immoral feelings. Sexual desire means to me to desire someone's body to instrumentalize it for your own pleasure. I have problems to ally sexual desire with love, especially with agape. I find it hard to sexually desire somebody who I do respect.<br/>If I consume pornography, I am not able to regard nude women as something worthy of moral consideration whereas if I am not arroused I never feel that disrespectful about women. I think my moral development would be more progressed if I was an asexual.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>In my mind, the least objectionable sexual practices on the second dimension are marriage-bed, missionary-position-type activities, and there is a gradient of abnormality and revulsion that includes masturbation, contraception, pornography, etc. The first dimension includes the consequent misery of sexual activity, encompassing sexual frustration, unrequited love, broken-heartedness, sexually transmitted disease, rape, etc.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I don't understand what problems you have with certain sex-position (non missionars-position-type activities), masturbation (Okay, here I am open to discuss) and contraception. To me as a wicked, faithless, liberal European this sounds like the remains of a typical puritarian upbringing. All I would miss is the sentence: "God hates homosexuals."<br/><br/>In my opinion, the most important problem with sexuality is that of involuntary pregancy (I have a problem with bringing people into being at all, but that's another point). I think involuntary parents take less care of their children what makes them less capable of taking care of others and gives them worse chances in life. I' ve found a <a class="postlink" href="http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/0/1/7/9/p201798_index.html">document</a> that claims that the liberalisation of abortions has lead to a decline in U.S. crime rates.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I am convinced that it is inherently wicked. It causes unimaginable, unbelievable, pervasive misery: from mild sexual frustration to rape-murder, it is (except bereavement) possibly the greatest cause of human emotional suffering. </div></blockquote><br/><br/>These two lines suggest confusion to me. You follow a sentence about it's instrinsic wickedness with, where one would intuitively expect to see a sentence explaining the one before, one which describes some exstrinsic harms it causes. Then in your ‘why is it instrinsically bad’ elucidation you basically do the same thing again!<br/><br/>It’s a very weird form of utilitarianism that says ‘let’s maximise those sensations that people like and minimise the others. Oh btw, let’s also prevent ARBITRARY THING OF DOOM.’ It’s certainly not a unique approach, but it’s never been a convincing one yet, since it’s so clearly contrary to the principle of parsimony. Why should anyone accept your proscription of sex if we wouldn’t accept someone telling us it’s ‘axiomatic’ that human rights should never be violated/that God should be worshipped/that Feng-Shui should be observed/that every second Tuesday of the month we should lick a tractor? <br/><br/>I wouldn’t normally talk about personal issues online, but if you don’t mind me asking, am I right in guessing it’s not  something you’ve experienced? I can certainly remember how when I was 14, going without it was a powerful source of personal anxiety. But that was largely because of the inequality of other people having it and (at that age) constantly boasting of it, plus the social embarassment of any effort, however slight, to go about getting it. <br/><br/>But those pains were largely enabled by our society’s repressive attitude towards it (which has improved, but not all that much). If it was just a pleasure like any other, few people would boast of it or belittle you for not having it, any more than they would if they had a new toy and you didn’t (ie the *really* unpleasant ones still would, but anyone with any sense would ignore them). And because all parents and teachers are terrified – or probably even incapable - of telling kids more reliable and stress free ways of finding someone to sleep with, courting is a) built up as a terrifying rite of passage to overcome and b) done so without giving anyone any idea of how they might overcome it.<br/><br/>And it’s all vicious circley – the more the fissure is built up, the more people believe it, leading to feelings like yours, which contribute to the same social repression. <br/><br/>One other wildly speculative comment I’ll make, if you have slept with someone before, is that maybe you’re un(or semi-)consciously gay (or – statistically less likely - asexual), and didn’t enjoy it for that reason. But my above comments still apply – not thinking about being gay is another consequence of sexuality’s stigma, and further stigmatising it as a result is equally as counterproductive.<br/><br/>Can I suggest you try and experience it (in some form you like the sound of) for yourself, and then see if you feel the same? I recommend googling ‘sex positivity’ to see sexuality cast in an altogether more open and friendly light than you’re probably used to, and maybe talking to some sex-positive utilitarians (ie most of us) to get a sense of how you might actually establish a mutual attraction with someone?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">I’m not denying you <span style="font-style: italic">said</span> it’s intrinsically evil. If you hadn’t I wouldn’t be replying about that. I’m pointing out that every time you get close to giving any kind of reason why it is, you move into (selectively) discussing extrinsic harms. That’s not utilitarian reasoning, it’s just applied confirmation bias.<br/><br/>Whether it’s extrinsically harmful is basically moot, since there’s no plausible alternative to living with it. If you genuinely prefer not to have sex, no-one’s forcing you to, but it’s a terrible waste of your time to try and talk the population out of something so natural, and with such low return on effort invested. Like <a class="postlink" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Better-Never-Have-Been-Existence/dp/0199549265">David Benatar’s</a>, your message is self-defeating, since anyone who accepts it will deselect themselves from the gene pool.<br/><br/>Moreover it’s bad memetically – it conceptually links you with crazy fundamentalist puritans, so is likely to turn people away from your other views. And it will make people think – quite reasonably given the sort of people who usually say this kind of thing – that you’re primarily claiming this because of tall poppy syndrome, ie envy, which again will make them more likely to think of your views as self-interested and so ignorable. <br/><br/>I basically do think the latter – to wit that you’re strongly influenced in thinking this by lack of success (because that’s so common a causal factor in puritanical views, especially where religion is involved) – but rather than wanting to discredit your other views I want to (on the assumption that I’m right) persuade you to relax, seek some advice on seduction/courtship (there’s plenty of it on Less Wrong if you want it from empiricists), and test my theory by revisiting your views after you’ve been successful. (Note that sex doesn’t actually have to be a net positive force in the world for this to be a good strategy to make <span style="font-style: italic">you</span> happier, nor is your doing so a zero sum game. You just have to go about it less aggressively than average)<br/><br/>Just think about yourself statistically for a moment – given how many people going through/emerging from puberty hold similar views to yours on reactionary grounds that they almost certainly drop or at least relax later in life, do you think it’s more likely that you’re in a similar position to them, or that from the force of perception alone you’ve spotted some vital and unique moral fact about the universe that all utilitarians have thus far missed?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Following a more strict utilitarianism, I put zero weight on the intrinsic harm argument.  I don't share that intuition.  A lot of your argument seems to focus on ickyness, and utilitarianism of all things has gradually moved me away from using my mere personal disgust to judge certain scenarios.  <br/><br/>When Haidt, as you alluded to earlier, asks one to imagine that a brother and sister sleep together once where no one else knows, no harm befalls either one, and both feel it brought them closer as siblings, I do have negative emotional reactions but am quite clear to recognize that I see no actual moral problem.<br/><br/>I also don't share your negative utilitarian intuitions, so I wouldn't remove a net positive thing just because it introduces some suffering.<br/><br/>As for the extrinsic harms on a more total utilitarian calculus*, I don't think you cite anything that overwhelms the positive elements.  Sure, sex does have some harms, and certainly the way sex is handled by society at large right now is entirely irrational.  But you might as well abolish televisions and the internet because mass media right now is terrible and they do introduce some suffering.  Or abolish bikes because kids might fall down.<br/><br/><span style="font-size: 75%; line-height: normal">*Note: I slant more preference utilitarianism than the folks here, so it might not be the classical calculus everyone is used to.</span></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Arepo: I am not sexually frustrated; I have never attempted to have sex with anyone, nor do I want to; and I am not a repressed homosexual or asexual. I believe these intuitions are innate. This isn't just a personal preference. It's not 'if you don't want to, don't.' It is a massive, pervasive and unrecognized EVIL. We have gotten semi-close to abolishing it in the past. Augustinian Christianity, had it been more widespread and had access to eugenic technology, would have cut this filth out of our genomes forever. The Japanese, as I discuss, have come close already. As East Asians rise, we will see a culturally (and maybe biologically) receptive audience to liberal Augustinianism. So, no, it is not alien to humanity - not much more than antispeciesism. <br/><br/> There is no need for liberal Augustinians to breed themselves out Benatar-style, so long as we regularly donate to sperm banks. Eugenic lobbies, even before the rise of germ-line therapy, can help create subsidized sperm banks - cf. Robert K. Graham and his genius sperm bank.<br/><br/>peterhurford: I'm not sure how to convince you or anyone. All I can say is that if you do not share my revulsion at, shall we say, 'abnormal' sexual practices, I can't convince you of the importance of the second gradient. But my essay mostly focuses on the first gradient. As for extrinsic harms, I can only ask you to imagine the following thought experiment: Imagine that alien anthropologists who reproduce asexually observed human sexual behavior. What would they think? Probably they would view it as we view hard drugs: extremely dangerous, a vector of disease, continually unsatiated, producing pervasive frustration and misery, ruining lives through its violent manifestations. I should, by the way, distinguish myself from social conservatives on the topic. Conservatives espouse bullshit like 'sex should be about love' or 'we're not anti-porn, we're anti-sex' - in fact, the affective element of sex IS the worst and foulest part. To make it absolutely clear, the element of sexuality that conservatives condemn is its intrinsic wickedness; the element that I especially condemn is its extrinsic wickedness. <br/><br/>If I can allow myself a little appeal to consensus, it is worth noting that pre-Russell, most philosophers who wrote on the subject, like Augustine and Schopenhauer, agreed with me.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">You mean most anglophone Abrahamic philosophers, right? Regardless, most pre-Darwinian philosophers believed in the creation story. Times move on, and saying 'as you look back into the past, the more ignorant people were the more likely they were to hold my position' is not a credible argument from authority. In fact, phrased more normally, it's a the precise argument from authority one might reasonably use to *attack* a position.<br/><br/>This is silly. If you're going to go around asserting things are 'evil' no-one will be able to persuade you of anything and vice versa. Ignore the extrinsic harm you assert for a moment, and try and suggest one good reason why a sex act that two consenting adults enjoy, which causes no harm is a bad thing. The prejudices of alien arts grads are not a reason, for what it's worth. Especially alien arts grads who couldn't exist because sexual reproduction is necessary for the evolution of life complex enough to develop intelligence.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I have never attempted to have sex with anyone, nor do I want to; and I am not a repressed homosexual or asexual.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I didn't say - or mean - repressed. I meant developing. In any case, if your feelings don't change in the next few years, then you *are* asexual (though again this is clearly odds against just from looking at the development of other teenagers), and certainly if you're describing them honestly and accurately now, then at the very least you're asexual in the same way a 3-year-old child might be. Which is fine, but then you should acknowledge that you have a strong aesthetic bias which might be affecting your judgement.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Individual sex acts might be harmless, but not sexuality as a whole. I am not advocating that anyone who is not cut out for it live a life of celibacy, only that sexuality ought to be abolished quickly. Another thought experiment (along the lines of David Pearce's): Imagine that you live in a future in which sexuality has been abolished. Would you want to introduce it back into the population?<br/><br/>I am pretty sure I'm not asexual. Asexuality means a complete lack of sexual desire IIRC.<br/><br/>Even in safe, wealthy, conscientious populations with readily available contraception, good sex ed, and liberal sexual norms - Scandinavia being a case in point - I am still pretty sure that sexuality is overall bad hedonically. There is still disease, sexual frustration, rape, etc. Even if hedonically speaking sexuality is neutral or positive, one still has to think about 1) NU, 2) the second gradient, which renders sexuality intrinsically bad even if its extrinsic bad were stripped away.<br/><br/>A pre-20th c. consensus is both good and bad. It is bad because before then, contraception was much more primitive and venereal disease was harder to prevent. Religion might have clouded judgments regarding sexuality as well. But it is good because it predates Freud and the Frankfurt School. IIRC, psychoanalysts and anthropologists of the early 20th c. spread irrational propaganda, based on fraudulent studies such as Mead's Samoa, claiming that sexuality was a wonderful thing and Western civilization was trying to repress it. BTW, Arepo, you are right to correct me here - there are quite a few pro-sex Indian philosophers whom I am overlooking.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Yes - I've frequently argued with hardcore speciesists. I advance arguments for my position and often they do too. We then engage with each other's arguments, and very occasionally, they change their mind (as I had to do initially - I wasn't born caring about animal welfare). Even more occasionally, anti-speciesists change their minds back.<br/><br/>What you're doing is <span style="font-style: italic">nothing like </span> that. You don't have the history of advancing arguments that have been ignored that your analogy suggests. You aren't giving a single consideration that anyone might be persuaded by even if the mere existence of an argument would have been sufficient to persuade them. The bigot here is you.<br/><br/>What's more you're actually advocating <span style="font-style: italic">harming</span> people, contrary to all your other apparent ethical views, just to stop them from enjoying a pleasure that you admit can be harmless. <br/><br/>Aside from anything else, you haven't even suggested a conversion rate for this intrinsic harm against the rest of your value system. How much harm is it ok to replace it with? Is breaking someone's arm to stop them engaging in consensual sex ok? How about sustained torture? How many times do you need to 'profit' by preventing two people having fun in order that it would be worth the hedonic loss of, say, burning someone alive to enable it? How much do your answers change if the sex in question is still harmless but extremely 'deviant' - say (still consensual) BDSM involving anal tentacle rape fantasies? (these are not rhetorical questions - I want you to answer them carefully) <br/><br/>'Insane' is the wrong word, since it implies you're too far gone to have the capacity to change your mind. I'm sure that's false. If someone approached you with the same argument where any other (pleasureable) activity in existence replaced 'sex' in your claim, you'd recognise them immediately as spouting virulently prejudicial, harmful and counter-utilitarian.  <br/><br/>If you'd just let yourself think about this the way you think about everything else, you'd be perfectly capable of seeing the universe does not single out sexual reproduction for special recognition. It's the same interaction of fundamental forces and particles are everything else.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

To add, I'd say that I'm not even sure what it would mean for something to be "intrinsically bad".  How would you know if something is "instrinsically bad"?  And why do you care if something is "intrinsically bad"?  My theory is that all cases of intrinsic badness are mere projections of one's personal disgust.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

How much harm is it ok to replace it with? Is breaking someone's arm to stop them engaging in consensual sex ok? How about sustained torture? How many times do you need to 'profit' by preventing two people having fun in order that it would be worth the hedonic loss of, say, burning someone alive to enable it? How much do your answers change if the sex in question is still harmless but extremely 'deviant' - say (still consensual) BDSM involving anal tentacle rape fantasies?

That's not to say that arguments about, say, moral consistency are totally lost on me insofar as they apply to practical ethics - only that consistency and logic is only one of several factors contributing to my moral intuitions.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

We've seen that clarifying the prejudice makes it appear absurd, but that you prefer to deflect the absurdity onto the person criticising your prejudice rather than deal with it head-on. You disclaim a belief in morality other than as an expression of preferences, but it doesn’t stop you demanding special consideration for your irrational dislike - and doing so in the aggressively unpleasant language of traditional bigotry. <br/><br/>Explain to me how we’re supposed to distinguish you in kind from an embarrassing grandparent who angrily spouts their prejudices at the family gathering, when their granddaughter shows up with a black boyfriend.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2">1. In such a world, as a negative utilitarian, I would still wish to eliminate sexuality. however, I would do so with much weaker fervor - I might not advocate the position at all.<br/><br/>2. OK. Here's my hypothetical apostasy.<br/><br/>There are a number of reasons why sexuality is a wonderful thing and ought not be eliminated. Firstly and most importantly, there is no evidence whatsoever for any intrinsic wickedness associated with sexuality. Such a view is nothing more than visceral disgust and Puritanism, expressed in the language of philosophy. Secondly, the joy of sex outweighs by far any misery. Sexuality had enriched the lives of countless people, and we would be fools to give it up. What is more, any significant pleasure involves significant pain as well - food entails obesity, music entails ruptured eardrums, philosophy entails existential crises. This reasoning would require us to eliminate all of our joys - everything that makes life worth living. Thirdly, even if I were right and sexuality was intrinsically evil and caused vastly more misery than pleasure, how would we go about abolishing it? Eugenic measures to remove sexuality would almost certainly require huge-scale coercive intervention. There are far more important problems in the world, such as that of speciesism, and we ought not to focus on such a trivial one as sexuality - even assuming I <span style="font-style: italic">am</span> right, and it <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> a significant problem.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2">This is a good discussion for the purposes of using it to reflect on your own beliefs.  If you have an entirely different belief but justify your belief or feel better about it because your belief is more popular, what other basis do you have to say that your belief has any better basis than this?  I would'nt say that sex "bad" but it does lead to overpopulation, which I see as the worst problem that compounds all others, and for many people, it leads to unintended consequences like disease or kids that people cannot afford to have.  Of course there are ways to minimize those risks.  If I look only at the outcomes that I don't like, I still can't say that the final result is that sex is "bad" or that it is "good"--I would probably prefer to focus on my aversion to the specific outcomes.<br/><br/>If the "sex is bad" belief catches on, the most direct effects would probably be something that I like (an end to the madness of population growth), but I'm not sure if there would be any increase or decrease in the net irrationality of people who adopt such a belief in the objective "goodness" or "badness" of things without an objective basis.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2">I did. You said you were an error theorist. As Arepo correctly pointed out, that basically means you're contradicting yourself. You can't simultaneously claim "All positive atomic ascriptions of objective value are false" and "Sexuality is intrinsically wicked". <br/><br/>But then you said what you *really* mean is that you personally are strongly disposed to want there to be as little sexual behaviour as possible, independently of the goodness or badness of the outcomes thereby produced as measured by utilitarian standards. Okay, fine. But as Arepo correctly observed, you have given absolutely no arguments at all to attempt to convince me to feel the same way, and you yourself said that you thought that the attempt to convince someone else would probably be a futile task. So the question then arises: why exactly should anyone be interested in this personal prejudice of yours? You want to make efforts to try to reduce the incidence of sexual behaviour; okay, fine, go for it. If it gets to the point of your actually advocating coercive measures against consenting adults who are doing no harm, then I'll try to stop you. But otherwise I'll leave you to your own devices. What more is to be said? What's the point of talking about it?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Here is an excerpt:<br/><br/><br/><br/>I am a social liberal, and this is what I do:<br/>I propagate debauchery, and reproduction too.<br/>...<br/>OK. Let's start by banning porn, then prosecute all trash:<br/>Premarital sex we'll quickly ban, violators get the lash.<br/>And as for banning porno: "art" is no defense,<br/>For then we won't burn Miller, and that just makes no sense.<br/>No birth control, no dirty pics, and no abortion too:<br/>No perverts of society, like you and you and you.<br/>...<br/>No freedom of economy or of private life too––<br/>well, why all these regulations? What's it gonna do?<br/>Well, this world of control, my friends, is but a stepping stone<br/>To a nation of no reproductive rights to call your own.<br/>We'll IQ-test the people when they all hit eighteen,<br/>And take some sperm and eggs from those far above the mean.<br/>Then we'll give all of the men some free and fun vasectomies,<br/>and as for the women, they'll get clitoridectomies,<br/>and we'll give both the sexes drugs that suppress libido,<br/>so there will be no fucking––this world is pretty neat-o!<br/>...</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
