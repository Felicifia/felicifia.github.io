<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">It's a commonly highlighted problem that in order to live the most morally effective life that means expenditure on only your basic necessities for health &amp; happiness, but I cannot honestly see how I can justify buying gifts or the likes for friends &amp; family. But that would be very complicated indeed and lead to a superficially immoral image within my immediate social circle. May I say that I'm 18 so this problem isn't too big yet, but in years to come and especially when I move out and hopefully find myself a full time job, it will be expected of me. How can I justify this? And if not, what do I do? Many will like to say "yeah but your already doing enough" but I feel this is a sincere evasion of the truth and just an answer given because one feel's the backing of what most people want to believe and that it is easier and that it is superficially pleasing as a righteous way of living. But the reality is that it probably is not justified to give someone a trivial gift when that money could save lives or to go further reduce a vast amount of suffering. It simply seems highly immoral to me.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

If you believe in maximzing happiness and minimizing suffering or even if you believe in equality &amp; are against suffering (which is merely a socio-political set of values) you would probably have to conclude that by putting your own fear of the complications amidst your immediate social circle and so forth, you are allowing immense suffering to persist to satisfy yourself and the trivial gains of those around you.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">The demandingness of morality can be great. Singer in 'Famine, Affluence, and Morality' agrees with you that morality requires giving until it hurts.<br/><br/>I appreciate your strong enthusiasm for reducing suffering. I would urge you to consider that giving to the point where you alienate yourself from society and family and friends may have seriously counterproductive consequences. First, it may be psychologically unsustainable, leading you to abaondon your project. This is the commonly mentioned issue in activist circles of burn out. Do what you can to avoid it. Second, in your zeal, you may lose your ability to win others to your cause. You'll almost certainly have a greater impact if you personally give less but can persuade others to join you than if you try to save the world alone. And on your view, having the greater impact is what's morally preferred, right?<br/><br/>My advice is to maintain your vigilance but try to keep perspective.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

It is possible even if the human being would be far less happy &amp; satisfied, as long as they don't break and lose it entirely and find ways to enjoy life for a limited time, they could do it. And I know Singer does not, but Singer though he is an absolutely inspirational and very moral individual, he is not a source of exactly how to live one's life.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Hedonic Treader wrote:</cite>But utilitarianism doesn't care about justice, except to the degree to which the notion is useful.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>In response to this I would argue that that's what I meant by justice, as in what is right or utilitarian-istically justified. I'm simply saying that it is possible to do as much as you can. Of course if you did so much work for moral effectiveness that you became morbidly depressed then you would be rendered morally useless, but until you reached that real limit, I just see it would be morally obligatory to reach that limit. I don't want to agree with this, but I think if you put it into perspective, every step behind the true moral limit is allowing vast suffering to occur for another individual somewhere in the world (human or non-human). That is the main point I'm trying to make. I'm not begging everyone to do this, but I'm just saying if this is true, then at the least I am seeking advice on how to best do this, but anyways back to the initial point of whether my argument is valid or not.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

In positions were people could become utilitarian then I agree with your point that one should not take this step and indeed as utilitarian values hopefully grow, scenarios were someone does not know someone who could become a utilitarian in their immediate social circle will decline, hence I would argue that such a logic I hold is something relevant for most people in this particular time, though as time goes on will become less necessary. Hence it is not a value/tradition per se to hold in the long term or try spread, it should be kept under the social radar and only used where necessary for the short term<br/><br/>3) I think with long term progress and a slow transition one could easily find happiness in a less social environment and on top of that could get off the hedonic treadmill. Some may fail, so perhaps there could be a basic test devised to see if it is morally worthwhile.<br/><br/>Your points have altered my view, but I still think for certain people (probably most, though I cannot back that up, I can just say certain people for now) that are utilitarian, most of those people capable of such a lifestyle change by using their will &amp; brain power and pushing towards it in the long term would be able to do it with a beneficial effect for the world in this particular time. This may seem really precise and in theory trivial in the scheme of thing's, but working out if would be right for someone is only a matter of moral progress toward a more utilitarian life anyways and stopping once it shows as having negative results after a certain point, so I don't feel it would be wasteful or potentially wasteful to try and push towards such a level of morality as there's very little to lose compared to what can be gained overall. It's hard to explain all of this in simple terms and in a neat enough format as so many points &amp; consequences to consider, but for the mean time, what is your view on my statement here?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

If you do, how do people in your social circle; friends &amp; family react or not react to you not giving them presents or at birthday's for example? But as you said perhaps your social situation is different. In mine it is the norm to give presents at christmas, for birthday's, etc.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

It's one thing if someone is not utilitarian, but another thing for them to actually <span style="font-style: italic">dislike</span> utilitarians.  We need non-utilitarians to at least be willing to get along with utilitarians.<br/><br/>Perhaps your individual lack of present giving will not have a large effect, but <span style="font-style: italic">in the aggregate</span>, all utilitarians refusing to give gifts would make utilitarianism work a lot worse.<br/><br/>~<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>deanmullen wrote:</cite>I think with long term progress and a slow transition one could easily find happiness in a less social environment and on top of that could get off the hedonic treadmill.
