<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Hello, <br/><br/>I'm Felix Felicis. I named myself after the drinkable manifestation of Plot Armour, this strange ability for heroes to get away with outrageously improbable plans over and over again because of authorial fiat, thus allowing them, and the audience, to escape the difficulty of utilitarian calculations and actual rational thinking (not strawman-rational thinking like Spock always does).<br/><br/>I was sent here from Less Wrong, looking for a community that shared the ideals but which had a curated forum system rather than the incredibly questionable Karma System.<br/><br/>I've also got a fanfic I would like to shill for a friend, which I bring to you because I suspect you might quite like it. It could be summed up as <a class="postlink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/Friendship-is-Optimal">"Ponies + MMORPG + AI =&gt; The Singularity =&gt; ????"</a> What part of the forum is most appropriate to post and discuss it?<br/><br/>There's also another topic I'd like to tackle, that of <a class="postlink" href="http://techpresident.com/news/wegov/22154/how-german-pirate-partys-liquid-democracy-works">the Pirate Pary and Liquid Democracy</a>, as well as the ides of <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhocracy">adhocracy</a>.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1"><blockquote><div><cite>Felix Felicis wrote:</cite>I find our lack of activity depressing.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>This is actually a surprisingly active forum. Give it a little bit of wait.  Usually people have to take time to think through what they want to say in response, if anything, which can take a long time.  And people are busy this time of year. <img alt=":D" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif"/><br/><br/>It might help if we had a few dozen active members rather than the current dozen or so... Maybe we could recruit?  There's a whole bunch of Facebook groups with ongoing utilitarian conversations if you're interested in any of that!<br/><br/>Or maybe you could search through our archives and find more things you want to offer your thoughts on!</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Welcome. I do wish there was more activity here too but I value the activity we do have. I think this is the best morality forum on the web. Recruiting is a good idea but I think you can stimulate more activity by posting more yourself. The more you post, the more likely our threads are to show up in someone's Google searching. Also, the more you post, the more others post in response, etc.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

I'm just interested in persuading some &gt;0 proportion of the FB group to come here, which doesn't entail persuading all of them, just as many as possible, b) Eliezer's argument seems to be (from a skim) just that no argument however logical won't persuade everyone, which doesn't seem particularly related to normativity, and c) I don't actually believe in moral imperatives, hence the winky.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>By the way, what' the general opinion here on Eliezer Yudkowsky?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Don't think there is one.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">To clarify, I'm not out to harm Eliezer's mission or prevent him from achieving most of his goals. You asked what our views were, so I gave you mine, which in a nutshell are that he's probably a force for good, but not so much that I would support him or his work over a number of other high-expectation causes. I'll clarify a couple of things below, but I don't think a long discussion of where Eliezer fits on the goodness spectrum is worthwhile.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Felix Felicis wrote:</cite><br/>i)What's hedonist util?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Sorry, I assumed you were more familiar with util. Hedonistic util(itarianism - sometimes just HU) is just the subset of util that defines 'happiness' (ie positive emotion) as utility, rather than the satisfaction of preferences (ie preference utilitarianism or PU). Pretty much all utilitarian thought can be partitioned into either HU or PU, though there are a number of other clarifiers one can add, which I won't go into here.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>v)That seems like fallacious thinking. What  bearing does the reason for his success have on the actual merits of his teaching? Does an author need to be impopular and obscure for you to trust that there is no foul play?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>It's evidential thinking ('fallacious thinking' doesn't really exist except in the mind of philosophers, IMO. An argument either has evidential significance or doesn't, and appealing to discrete fallacies is unlikely to demonstrate which). If a boring person persuades several people of their views, it's more likely that their prominence is due to their views being well-grounded (yes there are other reasons, but that's still one of them) than if a charismatic person does. For eg, I find Peter Singer, at least in a traditional sense, quite uncharismatic, yet he's still had a huge influence in person as well as in writing, which (if I didn't know much about him) I'd think spoke well of his views. If someone is particularly exciting, it should reduce our expectation of the accuracy of their message.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>vi)What do you mean, "the very concept of decision theory"? "expected value calculation"? "one's own form of utility"? "elegance"? I'm not being difficult for the sake of being difficult, but I really want to make sure that I understand you fully.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Decision theory is not my puppy, and one of my main complaints about it is its lack of definition, so I suggest just Googling that one. The expected value calculation of a decision is the sum of (each possible outcome * the probability of that outcome). So a 100% chance that I will give you £10 is worth the same amount (of money) to you as a 2% chance of me giving you £500 (assuming the only other possibility is you get nothing).<br/><br/>'One's own form of utility' relates to eg PU vs HU - so my approach as an advocate of HU would be to value a decision based on its expected hedonic value, and decide whether to do it based on the expected hedonic value of the alternative decisions I have available to me (in practice I'm not unselfish enough that it's so straightforward, but that's the basic idea. I can use a similar calculation while thinking selfishly if I replace 'HU' with 'my own happiness').<br/><br/>By elegance I suppose I just mean <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_parsimony">parsimony</a>.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>vii)If confidence in one's own expectations correlates well with the rate at which reality meets them, what's wrong with them being strong?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>It's not clear how much Eliezer's expectations do correlate with reality. What successful scientific predictions has he made?<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>viii)What's population ethics?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>It just refers to ethical questions addressing entities that don't currently exist but will/might in various conceivable futures. So it's not separate from consequentialist ethics, it's just an area of concern that they might address.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>ix)Never heard of them. Which might be the point; if it weren't for him, I would never have found out about this site, or about those authors, and "utilitarianism" might still mean "John Stuart Mill" in my head, which is very strongly tied to the tag "boring platitudes that completely miss the point", instead of "a sense of morality that bypasses mere common sense and actually tries to apply ethical considerations to their final consequnces".</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I think you're underestimating counterfactual thinking - ie what the world would have been like had Eliezer not written all this stuff. <br/><br/>There would still be plenty of stuff written about rationality and utilitarianism on the internet, Felicifia would almost certainly exist in some form, possibly more visibly since its current state is dwarfed by LW, and there would have been a gap in popular explanation of statistical reasoning that someone else might have filled. Meanwhile, millions of intelligent people's working hours would have been saved, possibly those people would have had less of a sense of moral or probabilistic clarity, but have had a lot more time to direct into things like actual scientific research etc.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that would be a better world, just that it's far too easy to think 'I can see some benefits that I've gained from X, therefore I'd be worse off had X not happened'. I recently read something about this bias, which I've now forgotten, annoyingly - it's an interesting subject.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>x)What's the Roko affair?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I read about it here: <a class="postlink" href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/LessWrong#Roko.27s_Basilisk">http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/LessWrong# ... s_Basilisk</a> (I don't particularly recommend the article in its own right, but it gives you some context about the string it referenced that you might want to read before following the reference, esp if you do find yourself agreeing with Yudkowsky in general.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Also, please go easy on me with the jargon. Do keep in mind that I'm a newbie at the "utilitarian" tribe? There's been other groups I tried to join with repelled me because of a divide in common knowledge that we did not share, that they assumed I should know, and that they looked down on me for not coming to them with that knowledge prepackaged.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Not a problem - like I said, I just misestimated how familiar you'd be with all this stuff from your OP.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>There's also one thing that's been bothering me.

If this is true, it doesn't really strike me as the most efficient way to gather knowledge or spread ideas.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>There are a couple of considerations here:<br/><br/>1) The anglophone world has a higher concentration of tertiary institutions, so a anglophones will make up a disproportionate amount of academia.<br/>2) Translation issues are certainly a factor - we're more likely to have read things in our own language, and our friends are more likely to read things we've read, so our bias (such as it is) compounds.<br/>3) 'Continental philosophy' is not 'philosophy produced in Europe', per se. It's a (not well defined) subset of philosophy identified mainly by its lineage (diverting from analytic philosophy between roughly the early 19th and early 20th centuries). Figures like Kant, Hegel, Wittgenstein are sort of pivots marking various points of diversion without being meaningfully called either analytic or continental (though Hegel leaned towards the latter). Obviously there's been a fair bit of discussion between them, but for the most part, after Wittgenstein's time, analytic philosophers tended to engage with analytic philosophers and continentals with continentals. <br/><br/>It's also characterised by being quite obscurantist - it's common for continental philosophers to spend a large part of their career interpreting the writings of other continentals, whereas you don't really get the same phenomenon in analytic phil, which is typically blander and more technical but clearer.<br/><br/>The reason I ignore it is mainly the same as I ignore most (but not all) non-utilitarian analytic philosophy (but more so) - because of its difficulty and the lack of any indication that one gains anything other than personal satisfaction from persevering with it, it has low expected value compared to, say, reading a maths textbook, which is difficult but provides personal satisfaction and actually has demonstrable effects on understanding the world around me, or just reading a novel/watching a film etc, which is not difficult and has similar hedonic benefit.<br/><br/>More anecdotally, it just seems to be full of unpleasant people whom I don't want to dignify with the epithet 'philosopher' - Schmitt and Heidegger were (to differing degrees) Nazi supporters, from what I understand of Sartre and De Beauvoir they were the worst kind of philanderers, who used to sleep with people just to score points against the other regardless of who it hurt, Lacan was close to being a cult leader, Zizek intermittently supports Stalinism when he's not contradicting himself, Terry Eagleton, seems to pick on people who advocate views he doesn't like and write full 'essays' and so on that consist mainly of abuse and belittling their conclusions (see 'Lunging, Flailing, Mispunching', and I think he wrote something similar on Hofstadter's I Am a Strange Loop, which I can't now find). From personal experience also in an English dept, the traditional hub of a lot of continental philosophers, disagreement with their views could get you ostracised and abused, especially if you disagreed with their politics, and I could add to that a few other - albeit not especially serious - personal experiences along similar lines that I can't really discuss in a public forum.<br/><br/>While I'm sure I'm cherry-picking to some degree, and there have doubtless been numerous unpleasant analytic philosophers, I have yet to encounter an unpleasant hedonistic utilitarian, people generally seem more pleasant the closer they are to HU and indeed most of the leading lights of utilitarian philosophy (eg Peter Singer, Toby Ord) really do seem close to being moral saints. (and believe me, the sceptic in me winced at least as much writing that as you will reading it). I actually can't think of an example of a well-known purely analytic philosopher who's famously unpleasant.<br/><br/>If (as I do), you think the main significance of philosophy is in ethics, then unlike in science (where Newton being an excretion of a human being did not make him much less of a scientist) the character of people who espouse a view is quite relevant to how seriously you might take that view, at least a priori. So while I have not read that much continental phil, I feel no more need to educate myself further on it than I do to read the Book of Mormon or Scientology scripture.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

First, why oh why does he use two spaces after terminal punctuation marks? Never mind, he stopped doing this. He is forgiven. But not totally, since he did it for so long. Second, why does he capitalize certain phrases, such as "Very Serious People"? Is it his version of scare quotes? I find it annoying.<br/><br/>Other than that, he's smart and clever. He could work on his public-speaking skills. He needs to take some lessons from Joe Biden or something, i.e., he doesn't come across as very likeable in the flesh.<br/><br/>EDIT: It is Paul Krugman, not Eliezer Yudkowsky, who uses the phrase "Very Serious People." How'd I mix that up? They're both charismatic leaders of sorts, but still. Maybe Mr. Yudkowsky doesn't engage in idiosyncratic capitalization after all. I could've sworn… So he's off on both counts.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>PU and HU: Isn't PU inclusive of HU? Isn't it tyrannical to impose happiness on people who would prefer other things over it, such as achievement?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Not sure what you mean by ‘inclusive of’. Certainly some people might argue that properly understood there’s no difference between the two, but some advocates of each will define their versions in ways that are clearly mutually exclusive.<br/><br/>What you’re arguing sounds a lot like <a class="postlink" href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/65w/not_for_the_sake_of_pleasure_alone/">Luke Muehlhauser’s argument</a> that because we can show that people don’t always seek happiness, HU is wrong (or maybe contraindicated, if you want a less philosophically loaded term). <br/><br/>I think it’s a very weak argument, since it’s essentially circular. If we judge against HU on the grounds that it contradicts our preferences, we have already tacitly accepted PU, since we’re making a preference-based value judgement. It’s equivalent to saying PU fails because it sometimes makes us unhappy. <br/><br/>Note also that on these terms, all common forms of PU fall on their own sword. Most advocates of the philosophy support some version more complicated than ‘having any preference satisfied is always a good thing’, to avoid conclusions like giving drugs to desperate junkies or fulfilling a preference that you hold based on a factual error (eg opening a window for you so you can jump out of the third floor of a building you think is burning rather than just pointing out to you that someone’s burnt their toast in the other room, and you’re actually perfectly safe). But clearly – by definition – such nuanced versions of PU conflict with what people actually want, so isn’t it tyrannical to impose on people their own nuanced preferences rather than the ones they actually hold?<br/><br/>To resolve the issue we need to somehow look beyond the value judgements of each form and somehow assess them without invoking them. How to do that is a long discussion for another thread.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Well, that seems legit as long as you don't think predictability is useful in and of itself in furthering your goals. Which it sometimes is, and sometimes isn't; isn't that factor quantified as "risk aversion"? </div></blockquote><br/><br/>We need to be clear on what we mean by ‘goals’ here. If you have a strictly quantifiable goal, such as ‘maximise utility’, then risk is irrelevant – you follow whatever path leads you to maximal expected utility. If you feel like risk aversion is fundamentally important then you’re actually making it part of your goal – which is then extremely hard to quantify. If you just literally mean it’s useful to achieving your goal, then you’re still ultimately running an expected value calculation, in which predictability is just one of the whole array of factors which you’re having to interpret. But I haven’t seen an example of decision theory helping you do so in a way that isn’t just mathematical analysis + value judgement.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Could you please elaborate on that?</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Forget I said it. I have a bad habit of throwing in bugbear issues to conversations which they just complicate.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>"Uncharismatic people who are still listened to are more likely to be listened to on the merits of the contents they release rather than on the form of them."

I don’t see it as a rationalisation in the sense of concealing ulterior motives). But it doesn’t really change my view – while I wouldn’t discount the possibility that naturally unkind people can just figure out something that’s more coherent about ethics than kind people have managed, I’d expect them a priori to have much lower chance of doing so, since <span style="font-style: italic">they’re</span> the ones more likely to be seeking rationalisations so they’re less likely to be as scrupulous in their analyses.<br/><br/>(it might not help here that ‘kind’ is a slightly vague or loaded concept, possibly reliant on one’s value system.

But on the same token, preferences aren't much help either:<br/><br/>1.) How do I make sense of preferences that I have, but don't want (don't meta-prefer) other people help me satisfy them? I want to quench my thirst all by myself, thank you. For some preferences, it would make me happier if (and I would meta-prefer that) you helped me, but for others it would make me sadder (and I would meta-prefer you refrain).<br/><br/>2.) How do I make sense of the idea of creating a preference for the sake of fulfilling it? Would it be a moral benefit to make you thirsty just to offer you a drink? Doing so would satisfy your preference, but wouldn't make you any happier.<br/><br/>3.) How do I make sense of preference satisfying population ethics? What good would it be, if at all, for someone to be born, who wouldn't be born otherwise? What good would it be, if at all, to launch a utilitronium shockwave?
