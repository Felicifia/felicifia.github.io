<h3><a href="#p4055">Optimal giving, x-risk, and the ethics of disagreement</a></h3>
<p class="author"><img alt="Post" height="9" src="../styles/nexus/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" title="Post" width="11"/>by <strong><a href="../user/898.html">GregoryLewis</a></strong> on 2011-10-16T16:24:00</p>
<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Hello all. Poorly cooked thoughts - my apologies in advance.<br/><br/>There's lots of discussion about how valuable x-risk charities (SigInst, FHI, etc. etc.) are. Proponents point to the massive divergence in utility between happy singularity and extinction (or "I have no mouth and I must scream" manevolence) and say that even if these charities are really ineffective, and even if your terminal events are extremely unlikely, and even if your error bars for all these things are massive, your expectation for donating to these charities is still zillions of times greater than health-based charities like VillageReach or SCI.<br/><br/>Sceptical people (like me) think there is something fishy about this sort of reasoning - on its face, it seems to generalize to pascal's wager, and my intution (dirty word I know) is that it simply sucks to spend all your money changing the balance of existential risk by (if you're lucky!) a nigh-infinetesemal margin in the same way it sucks to spend your sunday in church on the off-chance of infinite payoff. Far better, surely, to guarantee hundreds of lived saved by giving to NTDs or similar. So, in the time-honoured tradition, let's go fishing for philosophy to shore up these intuitions after the fact.<br/><br/>One option is risk-aversity, which I quite like (I far prefer a very negatively skewed distribution of utility across the worlds in my future cone over a higher average but very positively skewed distribution - I want <span style="font-style: italic">my</span> universe to be happy, not just sharing an antecedent with some <span style="font-style: italic">really</span> happy universe). But let's ignore that. Another option is playing statistics as to why high unbiased estimates with massive error bars shouldn't be trusted, even if you're only interested in maximizing aggregate (I think both LW and Givewell have chatted about this). But lets also ignore that: I'm not convinced we can use winner's curse type objections, if only because of the repeatability of people thinking "woah, x-risk is really important!"<br/><br/>Epistemic disagreement can ride to the rescue. The situation about x-risk seems to be fairly described as one of epistemic peers being in disagreement: similarly able and careful reasoners, with similar access to the data, are yet drawing completely different conclusions. Unless we have lots of credence we are better than our epistemic peers (which is pretty close to false by definition), there are two candidate epistemic practices I can think of.<br/><br/>1) Correction over sum of beliefs. If only you and Nick Bostrom exist, and your credence that your utility calculations are right and he is wrong is about 60%, then your final credences should be a 60:40 weighted sum between you and him. In real life, where there are lots of people, you need to do a much more complicated weighting (with lots o' bayes to avoid dutch book situations). In effect, you smear out your credence estimations: if you're convinced that x-risk is really important, accepting an odds ratio of you being right over an arch x-risk sceptic is 1.5 means you need to adjust downwards, and so on.<br/><br/>2) Rosseau-esque renunciation. I think it was in the Social Contract Rosseau said that, in cases where our beliefs contradict the popular will, we should conclude our belief must be mistaken. This isn't so crazy as I thought it was: we have limited insight to our own belief forming practices, but it's a pretty safe bet our cranial contents are a melange of rational and irrational elements. If so, then perhaps we should say that it is the central cluster of epistemic peers that are most likely to be right, on the hope that irrational quirks will cancel each other out or similar. If we ourselves are outliers, and even if we can't help but hold the outlier position (it might be a fact of our psychology that our brain, trying to be as rational as it can, cannot help but find the outlier position more persuasive than the central cluster), we should still act<span style="font-style: italic"> as if</span> the central cluster is correct, because it is more likely that an outlier like ourselves has fallen victim to a quirk of irrationality we lack insight to than the bulk of our epistemic peers.<br/><br/><br/>Back to x-risk:<br/><br/>If 1) is the right course to take, then evaluating x-risk giving becomes even murkier. We need to somehow work out what lots of other reasonable people think about p(singularity-esque-event), p(x-risk), p(charity-doing-any-good), and work out how confident we are that we're right rather than they are, and correcting our credences accordingly. Guess no one said reflective equilibrium would be easy...<br/><br/>It's a toss-up whether x-risk would get the nod here, but probably so. Again, we can point to the ridiculously vast payoff to defray worries about low probability, and the 'spread' isn't a big deal compared to central estimates. Even if we're exceptionally modest, and rate that non-utilitarians (and non transhumanists/x-riskers) are only just more likely wrong than we are, the integral of our corrected calculations is still ginormous for x-risk over any thing else. The reason for this is the fact we hold these beliefs means we must think we are more likely right than someone who disagrees with us (if not, why are you disagreeing with them!), so the degree of smearing can only be so much.<br/><br/>(Indeed, 1) is probably more effective in shifting sceptics - if I only think I'm a smidgen more likely to be right than Bostrom or Yudkowsky, then that drags up my corrected credence estimates to a level that makes x-risk giving a very high-expectation activity.)<br/><br/>If 2) is right, though, x-risk is almost certainly a bad idea. X-riskers are certainly outliers, and (I suspect) "giving money to x-risk charities will help x-risk" are an even smaller outlier. So either the bulk of non-x-riskers are much less rational than x-riskers, and consequently aren't close to being epistemic peers, or the x-riskers are outliers, and should think that they are probably victims of some irrational quirk. <br/><br/>Obviously, picking the community of epistemic peers is crucial, and this might well be issue specific (I'd be inclined to think the vast bulk of people are not my epistemic peers re. religion, for example, so I don't have to go to church, but they are re. keeping promises or whatever).  However, I find 2) generally persuasive: when even the smartest of us, explicitly striving to be rational, still end up (in effect) agreeing to disagree, we should stop treating our judgements as part of our rational selvs, and instead treat the outcomes as the output of a not-very-reliable channel to the truth. On this measure, giving to NTDs or other effective health interventions (which seems to command agreement from everyone asked about it) seems to completely beat x-risk (which I suspect 'the man on the street' would think is utterly crazy, and even experts are divided about).<br/><br/>(Final aside: Even if this is true, this isn't necessarily demanding we dump x-risk stuff. There's a case made elsewhere - Hanson, I think? - that having cantankerous outliers stubbornly combing their own patch of idea space is a better search strategy then everyone going to the central cluster - the outliers cost little, and might find lower troughs in the confirmation space for us to switch into. So (and I find this conclusion utterly mind-bending) an x-risker might find x-risk by far the most important issue facing humanity, yet realise this is probably due to an irrationality quirk he doesn't have insight into, yet still continues trying to limit x-risk just as before, because he realises that even though he is probably being wrong, it is more optimal for him to consider this far flung bit of idea space rather than join the crowd. What this would mean for charitable giving I have no idea: they'd be a trade of for maximum expectation against our guestimate of blowing money on unlikely-to-be-valuable outliers will yield a breakthrough to even more effective utilon generators.)<br/><br/>Anyway, I've run my brain into the ground here. Anyone with better ideas?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Hey Gregory, Thanks for the post!<br/><br/>I guess my main reaction is that I don't see how disagreement theory applies much to this case, because the principal divergence between the men on the street and the x-riskers is about values: x-riskers take an undiscounted sum of future utility, while ordinary people (including economists, explicitly) discount the future, and they often don't even care about animals or people beyond their communities. Other obvious differences: (1) Most people aren't utilitarians or even consequentialists. (2) Most people are risk-averse, as you suggested, so that they don't buy Pascalian wagers.<br/><br/>It seems to me all of the above are questions about what you value, rather than what the truth is. So looking at other people doesn't much help, unless you place value on trying to value what other people value.<br/><br/>As far as my own thoughts on x-risk, I'm not necessarily supportive of trying to reduce it -- not because I don't think the Pascalian calculation works (I think it probably does), but because I'm worried about the massive increases in suffering that could result. <a class="postlink" href="../thread/457.html">Here</a> is one thread on that topic.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Greetings from a fellow sceptic. I’ve discussed this a fair bit on here, so I won’t go into it at length, but my objections to the ER crowd can be distilled to something like this (all interrelated):<br/><br/>a) Precisely what you said about error bars. They make enormous assumptions based on almost nonexistent data about what the future will look like. As Alan’s discussed, it could be heavily negative.<br/>b) I am not particularly impressed by the prominent names in the field. Both Bostrom and Yudkowsky are actively scorned by most of the mathematicians/statisticians/theoretical physicists I know who’ve seen their work, sometimes with clear examples of their poor practice (eg Bostrom dismissing things as ‘implausible’, or failing to cite the originators of his ideas, instead citing one of his own previous papers that discuss them), sometimes with the complaint that (related to a) they just don’t have well defined premises. Also they seem to have a heavy bias against conventional views, which I rarely see them try to justify – the thought seems to be that large amounts of money already goes into these, which is true, but GWWC and Givewell offers a great example and stark warning of thinking that just because people have been pouring money into an end doesn’t mean they’ve been doing it *well*. Giving money to poverty-reduction now is thousands of times more effective an approach than it was even a couple of years ago, whereas I don’t know of any concrete result SIAI and co could offer to justify their funding.<br/>c) I’m not convinced by the views they’ve advanced. Eg coherent extrapolated volition seems like a trendy description of preference utilitarianism, and preference utilitarianism seems obviously less sound than standard hedonistic util, since it invokes obscure metaphysics with no physical correlate to claim that the universe somehow gets ‘better’ even if no-one in it actually feels anything different. HU only has to invoke obscure philosophy of mind with no physical correlate, which is still unsatisfactory, but given that most of us are clear that we experience better and worse mental states, seems like a far sounder starting point to me.<br/>d) (related to b and c) It’s far from clear that ER organisations offer the best way of reducing ER. Nuclear/biological war and deliberately malicious gray goos etc all tend to happen because people are unhappy with each other. In a world with fewer people suffering and more people encouraging each other to help each other *now*, you have far less motivation for anyone to make malicious use of these technologies, or to build malicious versions of them in the first place.<br/><br/>Not convinced your objections work if mine don’t though. 2 seems like an extreme version of 1, with little reason to believe it. I would much rather sum the beliefs of people who’ve given the topic serious thought than of every random person on the street, when most of the world is effectively logically illiterate. With 1, it’s true enough, but if you assign any credence to their Pascalian wager - ie a dollar given to them is worth thousands times more in expected utility than a dollar given elsewhere - then reducing your credence in their views by 50% isn’t going to have much effect on your expectation of that dollar relative to alternative causes.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

People in the poor countries killing other people in poor countries don't typically fall into these categories, except when the countries have nuclear weapons, like India and Pakistan. Car-bombers in Iraq probably don't contribute much to existential risk, at least compared with, say, the 9/11 attacks.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>and you'd clearly expect to find competence of all types coming more from rich families.</div></blockquote><br/>Exactly. So more wealth / education / technological knowledge lead to more serious terrorism.<br/><br/>Of course, we already knew that. Existential risk would be smaller per year if humans were still in the Dark Ages. But I guess the proper measure isn't "probability of extinction per year" but "probability of extinction per unit of progress toward space colonization," after which extinction risks will abate somewhat. You need technological knowledge to get to that point, so higher risk of extinction per year isn't necessarily a bad sign for those who want to prevent extinction.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Sorry for my delay in getting back to you guys.I've been following the wider discussion re. x-risk charities and their thinkers, and don't have anything of my own. But I would like to talk a bit more about my pet counter-argument.  <img alt=";)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif"/> <br/><br/>@ Alan Dawst<br/><br/>I agree that lots of the difference between x-riskers and the rest boils down to value-beliefs. But value beliefs are surely beliefs, and I think most are willing to acknowledge some chance their beliefs about ethics are mistaken: maybe util is just wrong, or your preferred subspecies of util is, etc. And so long there are right answers to these questions, then I think disagreement stuff is at least 'in play'. I could be missing something...<br/><br/><br/>@ Arepo<br/><br/>You are right re. 1). My mistake. <br/><br/>My development for 2 was very sketchy. I agree you should only apply 2) to your epistemic peers (and superiors) - although I'm perhaps more optimistic in the rationality of the 'man-on-the-street' than you are. What I was thinking was something like this:<br/><br/>Suppose you and a bunch of your epistemic peers think about X, and then there is a central cluster around some belief about it, but you are one of the outliers. I think standard epistemology of disagreement would say it's fine for you to keep your belief and believe the central cluster is wrong. I think a better approach is to assume that your brain is doing something erroneous. In a sense, you stop treating the deliverances of your rationality as the highest court of your beliefs, but rather one result to be weighed against others.<br/><br/>It is tricky to apply that to x-risk. Because I'd probably want to sub-stratify by a) people who've heard of x-risk stuff and b) some basic criterion of general rationality. On those measures it may well be the 'central cluster' is actually the FHI folks. There are other tricky problems (people with particular error-tendencies in their brain might be more likely to come across particular ideas, etc. etc.). Unsure. But I'm definitely sceptical about giving to x-risk.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">@AlanDawrst<br/><br/>Fair enough, but that seems to just shift matters one step back. Because so long as you assign some possibility moral realism could be false, then I think we can repeat similar sorts of moves. <br/><br/>I know a bit about emotivism (or at least it's descendants, like norm-expressivism etc.), but my understanding is that emotivism doesn't really have much normative content: no emotional reactions are better than another. If so, then if emotivism is true, it doesn't really matter what your ethical values/beliefs are.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote class="uncited"><div> So (and I find this conclusion utterly mind-bending) an x-risker might find x-risk by far the most important issue facing humanity, yet realise this is probably due to an irrationality quirk he doesn't have insight into, yet still continues trying to limit x-risk just as before, because he realises that even though he is probably being wrong, it is more optimal for him to consider this far flung bit of idea space rather than join the crowd.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>That sounds correct to me! The upside of all this mind-bending is that an x-risker can quietly devote a few years to decreasing x-risk without feeling desperate or marginalized or proudly heroic. The x-risker, like zir epistemic peers, is doing zir part to improve the world as ze reckons that this can and should be done, i.e., by zir own lights. Nothing would be gained by you (or the x-risker) trying to improve the world some other way, at least in the absence of evidence that was weighty enough to truly change your mind, and not just to induce a bit of skepticism. You (or the x-risker) might spent some energy recruiting or fundraising or explaining to people why their point of view makes relatively more sense, but the bulk of the energy would go to the cause itself, and there would be no need to stay up nights worrying about whether you've got it right.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
