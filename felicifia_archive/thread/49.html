<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">In response to faithlessgod's suggestion, here's a thread on objections to consequentialism and/or utilitarianism and our responses to them. In response to GordonHide's comments, I'll split them into two sections - criticisms that apply to any form of consequentialism, and criticisms that apply only to utilitarianism.<br/><br/>Anyone who wants to can post a response to some or all of the points - please make it as clear as possible which you're responding to. Hopefully this will effectively become a multi-author FAQ.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="font-weight: bold">General objections to consequentialism</span><br/><br/>1) In some situations [insert your favourite thought experiment here], consequentialism says we should do something which is clearly immoral.<br/><br/>2) In some situations, applying consequentialist ethics would create a situation which is clearly undesirable.<br/><br/>3) In still other situations, making consequentialist deliberation would lead to negative consequences<br/><br/>4) In yet other situations, applying consequentialism would mean becoming non-consequentialists.<br/><br/>5) Most consequentialist values are impossible to measure, so following aggregative consequentialism is impossible.<br/><br/>6) It’s impossible/undesirable to impose a structure on ethics. Better to rely on our judgement, and take one situation at a time.<br/><br/>7) Saying we should prefer some type of consequence is like saying we should respect people’s rights – a fundamental axiom that you either accept or don’t.<br/><br/>8) It's very hard or impossible to evaluate actions the way consequentialists say we should, because they might have very long term consequences.<br/><br/>9) I don't like applying labels to myself.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Specific objections to utilitarianism</span><br/><br/>10) Happiness isn’t a universal sum which everyone contributes to or subtracts from, it’s a subjective experience that varies from each individual to the next. Utilitarianism does not take seriously the distinction between persons.<br/><br/>11) Utilitarianism demands impossible sacrifice from us (this Demandingness Objection seems to apply to most forms of consequentialism, but maybe less so than to util).<br/><br/>12) ) Utilitarianism says that our only goal is to maximise happiness, but people obviously don’t act as though it is.<br/><br/>13) I agree with the sentiment of increasing wellbeing, but I disagree with the idea of using people for the benefit of others. It treats them as less than human because it disregards their intents and goals. So utilitarianism is a good starting point for ethics, but we must also respect human dignity.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Let me know if you can think of any that I've missed, or can think a better way of phrasing anything above. Also, let's keep this thread for immediate responses to the common objections so that it remains clear - if you want to argue a point, better to start it in a new thread.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>A</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">First, I put my vote of support behind this project. I like that it promotes utilitarianism and that it is practical: 1. It starts at home - Felicifia's home - the internet. 2. It deploys a strength of forum-posters, explaining why they're wrong and we're right. <br/><br/>I just read an essay relevant to this topic, RM Hare’s <a class="postlink" href="http://www.utilitarian.net/hare/by/1981----.htm">How to Argue With an Anti-utilitarian</a>. It taught me:<br/>&gt; that RM Hare was adversarial in his defence of utilitarianism<br/>&gt; that the first step in debunking an objection to utilitarianism is discovering whether we are thinking intuitively or critically.<br/><br/>I think that we should categorise objections according to the thought-processes of non-utilitarians. i.e. I think we can name categories more usefully than ‘semantic confusion’, ‘misapplication’, ‘indoctrination’ etc. So with this in mind, I suggest:<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Objection by Intuition:</span><br/>1<br/>2<br/>and, I'm sure, many more to come<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Objection by logic</span><br/><span style="font-style: italic">Applied utilitarianism is inconsistent or incoherent</span><br/>3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">Many people are not utilitarian so utilitarianism is not true (relativistic)</span><br/>5<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">The idea that we ‘should’ do one thing or another is not true (nihilistic)</span><br/>9<br/><br/>NB. In 5, like  4, objectors seriously misunderstand utilitarianism, thereby seeing it as contradictory. So 5 could be lumped in with Applied utilitarianism if there is a consensus on this. Also, Applied utilitarianism could potentially be split, I see 3 and 4 (contradiction) as a pair, 6 and 7 (incoherence) as a pair. And then 8 and 10 only half-fit in applied utilitarianism, but I felt I couldn't make a better fit anywhere else.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Thanks Gordon, that's very helpful. To clarify a couple of things, these are criticisms levelled at consequentialism/utilitarianism by nonconsequentialists, so they're unlikely to be phased by a 'you're not a consequentialist' response. I should make that clearer in the OP, though.<br/><br/>I should also clearly separate objections to consequentialism from objections to utilitarianism. At the moment I've got written 'utilitarianism' where the criticism applies only to that, and 'consequentialism' where it applies more broadly, but I've obviously mixed them up in at least one place (#3).<br/><br/>I deliberately avoided giving specific examples, since thought experiments are almost endless, but the details are inevitably irrelevant, since the fundamental objection always seems to be one of those in 1-4. Maybe I could give egs in a footnote, at the end of the post.<br/><br/>So, some editin' required...<br/><br/>[ETA] Some editin' done. More still to come - but I've messed up your reply Ryan, sorry. You might want to reorder your #s to fit mine.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">1. This is true of of every ethical theory, probably including your own. One example I've heard of for the including your own part is essentially praying while smoking is good (praying is always good) but smoking while praying is bad (it's sacrilege). Virtually all of these also involve assuming something that never applies in real life (for example, the muslims who think a cartoonist should be killed for a comic with Muhammad not being outnumbered by christians who don't) or involve not noticing less direct, but equally important effects. Also, some are just plain stupid (you can't stop a train by pushing someone in front of it, no matter how fat he is).<br/><br/>2. By the definition of consequentialism, every other action must result in a situation that's less desirable. Either that or it relies on incomplete information, in which case coming up with a situation like this for any ethical theory is trivial (if he acts like a consequentialist, go on a murder spree).<br/><br/>3. How's this different than 2?<br/><br/>4. If you assume that the person is omniscient, this is impossible. In reality, it happens all the time. We call it making rules of thumb.<br/>Edit: what I mean is, it's best to not try to think everything through at every moment. You'd never do anything. This is why we make rules of thumb.<br/><br/>5. Measuring it requires making large numbers of unfounded assumptions and simplifications. So does statistics. Considering that's a rather large branch of mathematics, I think we can live with a few assumptions.<br/><br/>6. That's meta-ethics. I can't speak for all of us, but I think it's not so much that we're imposing something on ethics, as we're imposing what we believe to be ethics (consequentialism) on reality. In any case, if you believe in determinism, you are going to be imposing a structure no matter what. Even if you don't, we all know that even though there's no clearly defined and logical structure to human thought, it's still pretty structured. In any case, completely not structured just means random. Does that seem right? I know I just used the fallacy for argument 1.<br/><br/>7. I agree completely. Why is this an argument?<br/>Edit: I'll change that to: Consequentialism requires only one such axiom, unlike other ethical philosophies. By Occam's razor, ours is more likely correct.<br/><br/>8. We can try.<br/><br/>9. It's not just about what you like. The question is: is there greater Utility in applying labels to yourself?<br/>Edit: This is an objection to calling yourself consequentialist, not an objection to actually being one. As such, it doesn't really belong here.<br/><br/>10. I know. That's why we made up the word "utility". It's the universal sum which everyone contributes to or subtracts from. Maybe you don't believe in such a thing. That's pretty much the definition of not being a utilitarian.<br/><br/>11. Utilitarianism doesn't demand anything. It just says it would be better if we did do (almost) impossible sacrifices. Just try.<br/><br/>12. That's because they're not (ideal) utilitarians. Utilitarianism wasn't meant to describe what you think.<br/><br/>As much as I like the whole "I can't be perfect, but I can try" counter-argument, it tends to result in another problem. You can't try perfectly, so you try to try, but you can't try to try perfectly.... Should we include that as an argument? Does anyone have a good counter-argument for it?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">On objection 11, <span style="font-style: italic"> Utilitarianism demands impossible sacrifice from us</span><br/><blockquote><div><cite>DanielLC wrote:</cite> Utilitarianism doesn't demand anything. It just says it would be better if we did do (almost) impossible sacrifices. Just try...<br/>As much as I like the whole "I can't be perfect, but I can try" counter-argument, it tends to result in another problem. You can't try perfectly, so you try to try, but you can't try to try perfectly.... Should we include that as an argument? Does anyone have a good counter-argument for it?</div></blockquote><br/>I like your discussion. I can answer it by taking is back to basics: utilitarianism tells us that greater happiness is better. We should do what creates happiness. Trying is an action. So in all cases, we should try in so far as it is helpful. That counts for trying to maximise X, trying to perfectly do Y, trying to try Z. Something like flying to the moon superficially might seem like it'll have positive consequences. But flying to the moon won't have positive consequences because it won't occur. It's impossible. <br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">I answer objection 11 below, touching on impossibility and sacrifice</span>. (It's a work in progress, but please criticise)<br/><br/>Firstly, on sacrifice: utilitarianism describes sacrifice rather differently from other ethical systems. It doesn't describe self-sacrifice as good in itself. Fundamentally, utilitarianism tells us the opposite. It tells us all of our happiness and/or preferences are equal. On poverty, for example, it says that one should decide an appropriate amount of wealth to share with others so that the combined happiness of all people is optimal. Utilitarianism suggests that:<br/>we do not disregard our own needs or others' needs<br/>we sacrifice our own wellbeing only to an extent that is psychologically sustainable<br/><br/>What utilitarianism does not do is tell us to try to act in a way that is impossible. For example, it doesn't advocate that we try to fly to the moon. Of course, if we returned from such a trip, it would create quite a buzz, but we shouldn't attempt to do so because these positive consequences are not going to be realised. These kinds of imaginary consequences don't count. So when we sacrifice our own wellbeing, we have to be realistic.<br/><br/>--<br/>Now, I note that some of your answers are <span style="font-weight: bold">circular reasoning</span>. They just say "If you don't agree with us, then you're not a consequentialist". Well, what we're trying to do here is refute objections to utilitarianism persuasively. Some of the current arguments are no better than the argument "god wrote the bible, therefore the bible is true, therefore there is a god". In particular, I'm looking at<br/>Gordonhide's answers 1 &amp; 2<br/>DanielC's answers 2 &amp; 9</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Hi rather than get lost in referring to numbers I will quote each list item in my response.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite><span style="font-weight: bold">General objections to consequentialism</span><br/><br/>1) In some situations [insert your favourite thought experiment here], consequentialism says we should do something which is clearly immoral.</div></blockquote><br/>Argument from intuition - response intuition can be mistaken, switch to critical level.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>2) In some situations, applying consequentialist ethics would create a situation which is clearly undesirable.</div></blockquote><br/>Hmm...it might be undesirable but if it is not immoral... this is rather unclear. I think you were indicating more the unreasonableness or injustice objections? <br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>3) In still other situations, applying consequentialist ethics would lead to a situation that's clearly contrary to their goals.</div></blockquote><br/>Of course, how is this an objection? If nothing was ever contrary to anyone's goals and no-one had any complaints there would be no reason for this forum! <img alt=";)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif"/> <br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>4) In yet other situations, applying consequentialism would mean becoming non-consequentialists.</div></blockquote><br/>I think we need an example to make this clear. Are some consequentialisms self-defeating? Possibly - but that does not refute consequentialism <span style="font-style: italic">per se</span>.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>5) Most consequentialist values are impossible to measure, so following aggregative consequentialism is impossible.</div></blockquote><br/>Argument from impracticality. The challenge is met by showing they are not impossible just variably difficult but even guesses and estimates are better than giving up before one has even started. And what alternatives are being proposed that are demonstrably better? None that I have seen,.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>6) It’s impossible/undesirable to impose a structure on ethics. Better to rely on our judgement, and take one situation at a time.</div></blockquote><br/>Is this an argument from casuistry or pragmatism? Impossible and undesirable are two radically different positions on this.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>7) Saying we should prefer some type of consequence is like saying we should respect people’s rights – a fundamental axiom that you either accept or don’t.</div></blockquote><br/>Ahem rights can be derived from utilitarianism and so does not trump utilitarianism but then rights are not absolute. (In DU there are no fundamental axioms of this type so no black and white acceptance is involved).<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>8) It's very hard or impossible to evaluate actions the way consequentialists say we should, because they might have very long term consequences.</div></blockquote><br/>So lets ignore any and all consequences? Throwing out the baby with the the bathwater?<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>9) I don't like applying labels to myself.</div></blockquote><br/>You alabelist!!<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Specific objections to utilitarianism</span><br/><br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>10) Happiness isn’t a universal sum which everyone contributes to or subtracts from, it’s a subjective experience that varies from each individual to the next.</div></blockquote><br/>One reason I reject HU.<br/><br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>11) Utilitarianism demands impossible sacrifice from us (this seems to apply to most forms of consequentialism, but maybe less so than to util).</div></blockquote><br/>Altruism demands sacrifice, utilitarianism does not have to.(DU avoids demanding sacrifice).<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>12) ) Utilitarianism says that our only goal is to maximise happiness, but people obviously don’t act as though it is.</div></blockquote><br/>Correct, (DU relies on this).<br/><br/>A good start but some stuff is too vague or too specific e.g. Objections to utilitarianism should to utilitarianism <span style="font-style: italic">simpliciter</span> not a specific version such as hedonic or happiness utilitarianism.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Here's another common objection to utilitarianism (or consequentialism more correctly)<br/>13. I agree with the sentiment of increasing wellbeing, but I disagree with the idea of using others as means. This notion seems to treat others as tools rather than as equals. It seems to depict others as "less than human" because it disregards others' intents and goals. So utilitarianism is a good starting point for ethics only if we bear in mind human dignity and the right to be treated as ends but never as means.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

So before we can make the analysis, an analysis must be made using the ethical ramifications of utilitarianism on whether the analysis is preferable.<br/><br/>Well, the same is true for that action, and the action that must inevitably follow that. This goes on to infinity. It is a paradox.<br/><br/>How must the (act) Utilitarian avoid this? Well, they must assume the action is moral. However, this is in ethical violation of the Utilitarian principle. And thus, Utilitarianism defeats itself."</div></blockquote></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

It's shown to be defective by examples from Peter Railton's <a class="postlink" href="http://philosophy.ucsd.edu/faculty/rarneson/Courses/railtonalienationconsequentialism.pdf">Alienation, Consequentialism, and the Demands of Morality</a><br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>A highly competitive tennis player comes to realize that his obsession with winning is keeping him from playing his best. A pro tells him that if he wants to win he must devote himself more to the game and its play as such and think less about his performance. In the commitment and concentration made possible by this devotion, he is told, lies the secret of successful tennis. So he spends a good deal of time developing an enduring devotion to many aspects of the activity, and finds it peculiarly satisfying to become so absorbed in it. He plays better, and would have given up the program of change if he did not, but he now finds that he plays tennis more for its own sake, enjoying greater internal as well as external rewards from the sport. <br/>...<br/>a sophisticated consequentialist has reason to inculcate in himself certain dispositions to act rapidly in obvious emergencies<br/>...<br/>Many decisions are too insignificant to warrant consequentialist deliberation ("Which shoelace should I do up first?") or too predictable in outcome ("Should I meet my morning class today as scheduled or should I linger over the newspaper?").<br/>...<br/>The sophisticated consequentialist need not be deceiving himself or acting in bad faith when he avoids consequentialist reasoning. He can fully recognize that he is developing the dispositions he does because they are necessary for promoting the good.<br/><br/>A further objection is that the lack of any direct link between objective consequentialism and a particular mode of decision making leaves the view too vague to provide adequate guidance in practice. On the contrary, objective consequentialism sets a definite and distinctive criterion of right action, and it becomes an empirical question (though not an easy one) which modes of decision making should be employed and when. It would be a mistake for an objective consequentialist to attempt to tighten the connection between his criterion of rightness and any particular mode of decision making: someone who recommended a particular mode of decision making regardless of consequences would not be a hard-nosed, non-evasive objective consequentialist, but a self-contradicting one.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Peter Railton is not a utilitarian, he's a consequentialist who believes in making morality more intuitive and less demanding than I do. But this objection of "self-defeatingness" is used to criticise to all sorts of consequentialisms and it fails for utilitarians just as it fails for egoists or tennis-pros <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/><br/><br/>I'll improve the opening post soon, by the way.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">biznor, your example here sounds very similar to the "lynching is fun" case, where you are a minority, but the racist town would get a lot of pleasure hanging you.  so the case was designed to show, if you were a consistent utilitarian, you would be forced to admit that you let yourself be hanged.<br/><br/>Basically, allowing practices like these would lead to them being performed generally, which would have bad consequences.  If you take Hare's two-level utilitarian view, there is the intuitive or "rule" based view for everyday actions like not murdering, stealing, lying, etc.  Then there is the critical "act" view where you can have time to really contemplate a situation, and perhaps breaking some of those rules might have better consequences than following them in certain instances.  If these Medieval townspeople thought that the practice of burning cats was an appropriate form of entertainment, this would lead to the needless suffering of many other cats in the future.<br/><br/>In my opion, the Medieval townspeople also have a false belief.  If you have the desire to drink out of your water bottle but unbeknownst to you it is filled with poison, your desire to drink this water bottle is based on a false belief that the bottle only contains fresh water.   Your aim was to quench your thirst and not to die which is what would have happened if you were allowed to drink from the bottle.  The Medieval townspeople as well as the racists have a false belief about the nature of cats and humans of different races and their capacity to suffer.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">The problem I have is that there seems to be a good case that can be made for cat-burning on the utilitarian theory, even if it's not absolutely certain that such an action is optimal.  Sure, it might be true that such entertainment would make people more cruel, but that's just a bold assumption about sociology with no evidence to back it up.  It is just as likely that allowing people to burn cats would have no impact on how compassionate or cruel the culture was.  Since the benefits of cat-burning are far more certain and probable than the possible, negative side-effects, it is likely that cat-burning was justified.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I've read there's some proof that equality being important implies that there can be times when it's good to add a person whose life is arbitrarily bad.</div></blockquote><br/>I'm not sure what you mean here.  Perhaps you could give an example?<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>If these Medieval townspeople thought that the practice of burning cats was an appropriate form of entertainment, this would lead to the needless suffering of many other cats in the future.</div></blockquote><br/>See my first paragraph.  We really don't know why people in the Middle Ages were so much more callous and cruel than people today (though there are a number of proposed explanations, see the clip below); we don't have enough information to conclude that cat-burning contributed at all to the apparent lack of compassion that existed in Medieval cultures.<br/><br/><object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ramBFRt1Uzk"/><param name="wmode" value="transparent"/><embed height="350" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ramBFRt1Uzk" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" wmode="transparent"/></object><br/><br/>I have also considered the possibility that the townspeople have a false belief about the cat.  Perhaps they would not be so callous if they weren't speciesists.  The problem is that people in the Middle Ages were almost as callous to other humans as they were to cats (see clip).  It seems unlikely that their false beliefs were the cause of their insensitivity.<br/><br/>One last thing I'd like to say is that this argument presents as much of a problem to speciesist rights theorists as it does for utilitarians.  If utilitarianism can't account for the wrongness of cat-burning, animals may very well have rights.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">thanks for posting the video biznor, had seen this already but not for a while.  Pinker, secret utilitarian?  he sites both Wright, a utilitarian sympathizer, as well as Singer as having two views that he finds to be plausible for his thesis on the decline in violence in the video.  I went back and checked my copy of Pinker's "The Blank Slate" and he references both "The Expanding Circle" and "A Darwinian Left" by Singer to make his main point in his chapter on politics as well.  A copy of "The Expanding Circle" was hard to track down.  Long out of print, I was going to buy a copy but it's at least 30 dollars for a used one on any book site, so I went to my university library to reference it.  Singer says it is one of his least well known works in "Peter Singer Under Fire".  Here is the main epigraph at the beginning of "The Expanding Circle":<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The moral unity to be expected in different ages is not a unity of standard, or of acts, but a unity of tendency....At one time the benevolent affections embrace merely the family, soon the circle expanding includes first a class, then a nation, then a coalition of nations, then all humanity, and finally, its influence is felt in the dealings of man with the animal world.<br/><br/>--W.E.H. Lecky, The History of European Morals</div></blockquote> <br/><br/>So if we take this as a starting point, clearly the the Townspeople had a "smaller circle" than we, and did not include the interests of the cat or the "animal world" in their consideration because they were both literally and figuratively "sub-human" to them, to use the same phrase as Pinker.  They also did not have a sufficiently "cosmopolitan" attitude; they did not have the Darwinian history that shows our common ancestry with the tortured cat(s).   <br/><br/>biznor, you say that cat burning may not be optimal, and that it might be true that this form of entertainment could make people more cruel, but you are still skeptical.  I personally fail to see how it would be just as likely to be impact-neutral on the compassion of the Townspeople, and I also do not see how the benefits are more certain than the negative side-effects.  Even if we do not have precise evidence about why inhabitants of the Middle Ages were not compassionate, this still does not mean that they were justified on utilitarian grounds to burn their cats.  Perhaps these people were just as cruel to other humans, I think this is still a false belief, or maybe having an insufficiently "cosmopolitan" attitude.  And so I don't find this scenario is a problem for utilitarians; I think that the cat burning was wrong, and that the cats do not have "rights" as such.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Something that rarely gets offered in these discussions is that maybe, when you make the circumstances extreme enough, cat burning becomes ok. That's basically what these examples are trying to get at, and it's basically a truism for consequentialists - any finite amount of unpleasantness can theoretically be justified by preventing a greater unpleasantness.<br/><br/>I'm fine with that, personally, and I'd turn the question around to anyone who criticises - can you really imagine no calamity so bad that you wouldn't consider sacrificing a cat to prevent it? Once you've got them to agree to that, it's like that old (and mildly sexist...) joke:<br/><br/>Man: Would you sleep with me for £1,000,000?<br/>Woman: Yeah, I suppose so.<br/>Man: Will you sleep with me for £5?<br/>Woman: What kind of person do you think I am?!<br/>Man: We've established that.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">The utilitarian RM Hare would begin by challenging the objector to state whether he is objecting on an intuitive or analytical basis. If the objector is using pure intuition, he must concede that our intuitions can not always be trusted in odd hypothetical scenarios such as this worldwide headache. If, on the other hand, the objector is analysing the scenario analytically, he must be prepared to come to a conclusion that he was not prepared for when he began the analysis. That is, in analysis, unintuitive conclusions are okay.<br/><br/>The utilitarian, ultimately, argues that our analysis should favour one terrible and painful death over a sufficient number of headaches. Although our intuition leads us to favour a million headaches, our intuition is wrong. It is systematically wrong in this sort of scenario because the human mind places unreasonable emphasis on quality of experience at the expense of quantity of experience. <br/><br/>Here's another thread where I've treated the issue: <a class="postlink" href="../thread/213.html#p1440">http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=213#p1440</a></div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">Biznor,<br/><br/>There are a couple of possible responses. One is that the suffering to the cat is so great that there would need to be an audience that is extremely large in order for it to be worthwhile (this depends on how much utility weight you give to the suffering of cats, since it is almost certainly less than humans). <br/><br/>Another possible response is the negative utilitarian response that no amount of happiness can justify suffering. <br/><br/>A third possible response is that certain forms of suffering and happiness are just categorically different and thus no amount of one can aggregate to the other, even though aggregate utility still applies in many or most cases.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="1">The utilitarian stance on individual rights (ie. burning cats if it increases pleasure in more beings than it causes suffering in) is why I can't consider myself to be a utilitarian, even though I consider myself to be a consequentialist. I think it's acceptable to sacrifice one's interest to prevent even greater harm to another (ie. using force to prevent a rapist from harming a woman, it will cause him distress but less distress than it would cause the woman to not stop him) but I don't understand the (stereotypical, maybe straw man?) utilitarian argument that 'the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few'. 100 people suffering is no worse than 1 person suffering, at least not on the basis that there's one hundred of them. Suffering is a private, subjective experience, nobody else has direct access to what you feel because your 'mind' is a self-contained, separate universe. I'm open to any counter argument, maybe I just don't understand what utilitarianism actually means. Until I'm convinced otherwise, I'm going with hedonist-consequentialism/an ethics of empathy.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2"><blockquote><div><cite>DanielLC wrote:</cite>I don't understand what he's trying to say.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Was that a reference to my post earlier that day: "It was never contended or conceited by a sound, orthodox utilitarian that the lover should kiss his mistress with an eye to the common weal" (John Austin, The Province of Jurisprudence Determined, 2nd Edition, 1861, p. 101)<br/><br/>Austin was denying that utilitarians always act for the benefit of the greatest good by saying that guys kiss their girlfriends because of selfish desire.  I think his comment was directed toward Bentham's work with respect to the conduct of governments.  As an individual, I could adopt a selfish utilitarianism in which kissing my girlfriend is an expected consequence of utilitarianism, but if I had a day-job as a politician I might need to look toward the greatest good for the entire city (or state or nation).  I think Austin is denying the second type of motivation.<br/><br/>Austin's comments would apply to individuals who assert that they choose their personal actions to benefit some greater good (the city, all humans, all life forms, etc.).  It is common in this forum for people to justify vegetarianism because the alternative reduces global utility.  Austin might make the inference that the vegetarians claim to always act "with an eye toward the common weal" in all situations, but I see this as an error.  What vegetarians might do is avoid positive acts that cause disutility (i.e., avoid killing animals for food or paying somebody to do so), but at the same time vegetarians can pursue selfish interests as long as they incur minimal disutility to innocent bystanders (e.g., listening to music instead of digging a water well for a poor person).</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="2">Well this objection says that kissing one's girlfriend is selfish and un-utilitarian. I think that there are a lot of things that are utilitarian about kissing one's girlfriend. Firstly, if you don't engage in romance, you won't sustain a relationship, and that could well cause you greif. It could reduce your productivity too. Secondly, utilitarianism doesn't demand people to do the impossible. People can't be persuaded to live without romance, and encouraging them to do so is a waste of time. Utilitarianism depends on its persuasiveness. Consider this. If I directly act to reduce poverty, I may contribute one lifetime's salaries to this cause. If I instead persuade two others to be utilitarian, this can contribute up to twice as much to this cause. If I live my life as a moderately effective evangelist for utilitarianism, I can be twice as effective as I would be if I had directly donated to charity. Trying to live without romance is futile, and it will inhibit efforts to spread utilitarianism. So utilitarianism should embrace romance.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="3"><blockquote><div><cite>Arepo wrote:</cite>6) It’s impossible/undesirable to impose a structure on ethics. Better to rely on our judgement, and take one situation at a time.<br/><br/>8) It's very hard or impossible to evaluate actions the way consequentialists say we should, because they might have very long term consequences.<br/><br/>10) Happiness isn’t a universal sum which everyone contributes to or subtracts from, it’s a subjective experience that varies from each individual to the next. Utilitarianism does not take seriously the distinction between persons.<br/><br/>11) Utilitarianism demands impossible sacrifice from us (this Demandingness Objection seems to apply to most forms of consequentialism, but maybe less so than to util).<br/><br/>13) I agree with the sentiment of increasing wellbeing, but I disagree with the idea of using people for the benefit of others. It treats them as less than human because it disregards their intents and goals. So utilitarianism is a good starting point for ethics, but we must also respect human dignity.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>These seem to be the most accurate.<br/><br/>Put even more concisely, consequentialism forces people to assume the risk of suffering, frustration, and punishment.  The point of living under the rule of law, however, is overcoming the state of nature.<br/><br/>In other words, consequentialism, ironically, DISCOURAGES people from being rational since people don't know potential benefits in advance of experience.  People are not allowed to be risk averse because they have to assume risks to find out what happens.  Those lacking confidence are condemned as hopeless.<br/><br/>Consequentialism also seems to be an excuse for bad communicators.  For example, a parent who hits a kid to teach that kid how not to behave rather than actually explaining why something is wrong.<br/><br/>Consequentialism also relieves people from communicating what's right.  For example, a parent could teach a kid nothing, and then expect that kid to act out, forcing the kid to assume the risk of punishment in learning right and wrong.<br/><br/>In short, I don't see any difference between a utilitarian society and a hostage situation.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Consequences which take place after an inflicter passes away don't mean anything.  There's nothing inhibiting an inflicter from hurting others in pursuit of "Moon or bust."<br/><br/>In the case of operant conditioning, this means a conditioner wouldn't see a problem with forcing a pupil to endure a gauntlet of punishment, even if that means the pupil's complete destruction because the conditioner only wants haughty pupils.<br/><br/>Ergo, the conditioner would be taking one's own externally granted quantitative thickskin for granted, ignoring the internal qualitative subjectivity of personhood.<br/><br/>----------<br/><br/>Put simply, the consequentialist ignores a priori reason, believing people must assume the risk of learning from experience.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>
