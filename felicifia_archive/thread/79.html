The top rated charity could give a blind person a guide dog for each $50,000, while the Fred Hollows foundation can *cure* someone of blindness for $53.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Thanks Toby - good luck with your thesis, if you get a chance to read this before you hand it in.<br/><br/>One of the objections I frequently hear to charity (that I'm not above raising myself) is that the root cause of much of the world's poverty (and to a lesser degree other suffering) is basically overpopulation. If so, then supporting charities which just cure/prevent disease etc is ultimately much less effective than supporting those that (humanely) limit population growth somehow. The problem is, the only assessment I've been able to find of such approaches was pretty negative, suggesting that people being given contraceptives in developing countries weren't using them.<br/><br/>I know you don't agree with the overpopulation assessment, but for those who do, or who see ignoring it as too big a risk, do you know of any effective population-limiting charities?<br/><br/>Similar question re the environment, particularly climate change - for those who believe reckon environmental factors will do more harm than any others, do you know enough to highlight charities that combat them effectively?</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

If we ask competing lobbyists to agree to commit fair portions of their funds to an agreed charity, then lots more constructive work will be done for society. <br/><br/>However, we would face a powerful objection: "but competing campaigns aren't really zero-sum. Competing campaigns may, on the balance of things, not persuade audiences. But they at least promote interest in the issue. Lobbyists on either side of the fence agree that their issue is important. And they agree that one party is right and that the other is wrong. And if consciousness of the issue is raised, we're a step closer to making appropriate conclusions and actions (on guns, politics, etc)." And we would have to concede this point. Some proportion of what campaigns do is help to build dialogue. However, we could target the campaigning that least persuades and most informs and engages. By being selective in this way, we could put a lot of money towards really constructive causes without removing much money from publicising the issue. <br/><br/>Indeed, the act of putting campaign money towards a worthy cause could attract immense positive publicity in itself. Furthermore, we could dedicate some portion of the committed funds to publicise the lobbyists and explain the exceptional action that they've taken. Of course, there are tough practical issues to overcome like:<br/>&gt; how can we present lobbyists in equal light?<br/>&gt; does fair portions mean equal funds or equal proportions of funds?<br/>But given our ability to reduce wastage of money so dramatically, I think it'd be a shame if we let these practical concerns stop us!</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">RyanCarey, I like, in theory, the idea of "lobbyist arms control" that you and Toby propose, though my suspicion is that it would be very hard to implement in practice. Part of the difficulty is, as you suggest, quantifying how much each side will cut back (each side can always say that it spends its money more efficiently and therefore would be hurt more by a given reduction in funds). Even worse is that the organizations might fear losing their donors: Why would people send checks to a pro- or anti-choice group that they know will dedicate a portion of their donation for some unrelated purpose? Yes, it does make sense to the extent that it defuses money spent by the other side, but I have a feeling most people wouldn't swallow that kind of reasoning, unfortunately....</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Why do you value obscurity, EU? I can imagine it often being a sign that your donation will have a proportionately larger effect on the cause, but if that's the issue then it would surely be simpler to seek increased proportional weight per contribution directly. And it's not obvious that there's anything important about that - if Fred Hollows were a major charity who received billions each year but had not yet cured enough people to raise the cost of their cures to over the current ~$20 and Seeing Eye a minor charity who hardly anyone had heard of, it would still make sense to support the former.<br/><br/>I don't know enough to say anything useful about the weightings in your blog, but one stylistic suggestion is to change 'O' as shorthand for obscurity, even if you keep it as a category - simply because it looks too much like a digit, and makes skimming your weightings harder than it needs to be. For similar aesthetic reasons, it would be clearer to give a new line to each rating:<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="font-weight: bold">Prizes for Technology Commons <br/><br/>U=9 <br/>A=6 <br/>O=8<br/>T=23</span></div></blockquote><br/><br/>rather than <br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="font-weight: bold"><br/>Prizes for Technology Commons (U=9 A=6 O=8) 23</span></div></blockquote><br/><br/>I'd also suggest treating attainability as a measure of probability, somehow, rather than an additional bonus in its own right. Ie. you should multiply utility (and obscurity, if you keep it) by attainability, rather than summing them - so something with utility 5 and probability (0.)5 would be better than something with utility 9 and probability (0.)2. At the moment, the latter would seem better.</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

Donating to Oxfam is, in a sense, an empathy tax. The causes Oxfam is dedicated to are for the most part widely recognized as necessary. Thus, this is something which is truly a collective responsibility, and actually individual donations have a perverse incentive which makes the need for collective responsibility seem less urgent.<br/><br/>Obscure causes on the other hand are not widely recognized as useful, and thus individual responsibility is absolutely essential.<br/><br/>Thanks for the pointers about the ranking system.
