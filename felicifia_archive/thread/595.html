<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">Oh dear im afraid this has turned out quite long, I've been trawling around the internet trying to get info on how effective fundraising is. Its easy to find information from the perspective of a charity but much harder to find out how much donations individual fundraisers are (partially) responsible for.<br/><br/>I'm gonna continue looking into it, but I found this stuff so far very interesting so I thought I'd post it here.<br/><br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">1.</span><br/><br/>"The average monthly donor gives between $18 and $20, and many of those who signed up in 2002 are still giving monthly today, said co-founder and president John Finlay."<br/><br/>"The pay is $13 an hour plus benefits, with no commissions: Imagine Canada, a charitable umbrella organization, and the Association of Fundraising Professionals both prohibit them. Still, many canvassers set personal goals of signing three or four monthly donors a day"<br/><br/><a class="postlink" href="http://publicoutreachgroup.com/ca-fr/blog/2012-01-31/canvassers-take-cause-street">http://publicoutreachgroup.com/ca-fr/bl ... use-street</a><br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">from what I've read so far 3 monthly donors a day seems like maybe a general figure I'll use until I've got more information.<br/><br/>if the average donor is giving $19 a month for 5 years thats = $19 x 12 x 5 = $1140<br/><br/>and if the average fundraiser is signing up 3 people per day = $1140 x 3 = $3420<br/><br/>and if the fundraiser works an 8 hour day they're total daily donation will be = $3420 - ($13 x 8) = $3420 - $104 = $3316/working day<br/><br/>thats canadian dollars so, $3316 (CAD) = 3,344.32 (USD)</span><br/><br/>"Founded in 2002, the company guarantees charities between a 2:1 and 3:1 return on investment over a five-year campaign, with the agency absorbing the risk."<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">huh? if the amount a fundraiser is getting people to donate per day is over $3000, and if the returns are 3:1, is that to say that a charity spends $1000 to get $3000? (or does the charity invest $1000 to get $4000 as I believe betting works??)<br/><br/>because to make that &gt;$3000 the fundrasing organisation is spending much less than $1000! if the fundraisers daily wage is $104 and then maybe they have some administration costs but maybe they are making a lot of money?...</span><br/><br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">2.<br/><br/>Wikipedia cites similar returns (tho link is dead:/)</span><br/><br/>"The fundraisers may be employed directly by the charity as part of an 'in-house' team. They may also be employed by an agency working specifically in the area of fundraising. In this case, the company is usually paid a fixed fee per person signed up. This fee depends on a number of variables, such as the number of donors required and the average annual donation desired. Though charities can normally expect to generate a minimum return on their investment of 3:1 over the duration of a donor's giving relationship with them.[1]"<br/><br/>"On average, the supporter who signs up on the street will continue giving for 5 years. Regular giving is understood by those working in the charity sector as the most effective form of giving, allowing for long term planning. So, a supporter giving £10 a month will, over 5 years, give £600 to the charity, and also lead to the likelihood of the charity claiming Gift Aid, a further 25% tax relief from the government[citation needed]"<br/><br/><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_fundraising">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_fundraising</a><br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">does this mean the charity gets an extra 25% of £600 ? I thought a donation had to be one single donation over a certain amount to qualify for this?<br/><br/>1 supporter = £600 = $953.68<br/><br/>or 1 supporter = £600 + 25% of £600 = £600 + £150 = £750 = $1,191.69<br/><br/>which is comparable to the first figure.<br/><br/><br/>3.</span><br/><br/>"Besides, look at the facts: in the financial year of 2009-2010 street fundraising brought in 177,665 brand new donors to various charities, giving, roughly, on average £8 per month.<br/><br/>That’s not including gift aid and let’s not get into the debate on how many people drop out – because with rising minimum ages and stricter quality controls, attrition’s not the issue that it may have been in the past. As for myself, I run two teams of fundraisers for the British Red Cross and, with the amount of new donors we’re on course to recruit this year, will raise £1,500,000 projected over a three-year period."<br/><br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blogs.redcross.org.uk/fundraising-and-events/2010/08/guest-post-in-defence-of-chuggers/">http://blogs.redcross.org.uk/fundraisin ... -chuggers/</a><br/><br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">4.</span><br/><br/>"Once a donor signs up, the standing order lasts six years on average"<br/><br/>"I started on £8 an hour and am now on £10. There are targets - we're supposed to sign up five people a day - but it doesn't affect your pay."<br/><br/>"This is the most efficient and cost-effective way for a charity to raise money. It gives enough scope to plan for the future (the average donor gives for about 5-6 years) and not waste money. While there is still so much poverty, suffering and death I feel that being as understanding and as generous as possible is the least we can do.<br/>Kim, England"<br/><br/><br/>"I worked as a chugger but only lasted one week. My agency paid commission and the targets were tough. Seeing how automated and pushy some of my colleagues were made me quit ASAP.

DialogueDirect also reports on its web site that its "Dialoguers" or street solicitors "are averaging between $500 and $1000 per week." A full-time 40-hour week at $9.14 per hour is only $365. This means that the average solicitor earns 27% to 63% of their pay by meeting "performance and quality targets.""<br/><br/>"The web site of DialogueDirect states that they "charge [to the charity] a flat fee for donors acquired.""<br/><br/>"Children International pays DialogueDirect $210 for each new child sponsor who agrees to a minimum monthly donation of $22, according to the charity's current fundraising contract with DialogueDirect. This means that a donor will have to make regular $22 payments for ten months before any of their contribution can start to benefit children. The campaign goal, according to the fundraising contract, is 19,048 new Children International sponsors for a $4 million fee to DialogueDirect."<br/><br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.charitywatch.org/articles/street_solicitations.html">http://www.charitywatch.org/articles/st ... tions.html</a><br/><br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">6.</span><br/><br/>"Some large charitable groups pay up to £136 to outside companies for every direct debit secured on the street by professional fundraisers or ‘charity muggers’."<br/><br/>"On average, charities pay about £100 for everyone who they persuade to sign up.

<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0">I suspect a great fundraiser can be very effective. Recently one such person shared his knowledge with <span style="font-style: italic">Giving What We Can: Rutgers</span> - he said he was able to average over $3,000 per week (fundraising for ? UN Health organization). Most of the fundraising occurs on weekdays in the evening for about 4 hours, visiting perhaps 100 doors. Knowing the skills, others can get similar or better results. <br/><br/>After hearing his lecture I am considering learning the skills to do this on the side of my full-time job or as a summer recreation (as a teacher I have summers off).</div><div class="diff hidden"></div></div>

<p class="author"><img alt="Post" height="9" src="../styles/nexus/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" title="Post" width="11"/>by <strong><a href="../user/64.html">Brian Tomasik</a></strong> on 2012-04-08T10:15:00</p>
<div class="content"><div class="postrev" data-snap="0"><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>I'm gonna continue looking into it, but I found this stuff so far very interesting so I thought I'd post it here.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>This is great stuff. Thanks!<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>if the fundraisers daily wage is $104 and then maybe they have some administration costs but maybe they are making a lot of money?...<br/></div></blockquote><br/>$104 per day is really cheap. <img alt=":)" src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif"/><br/><br/>Yeah, there must be startup costs, admin costs, and days when fundraising doesn't go so well, but even so, these figures suggest that fundraising is wildly cost-effective. Why don't more organizations do it? I can't imagine the market for donors is so saturated that additional fundraising would hit low marginal returns.<br/><br/>Fundraising probably has higher returns for more widely supported and conventional causes (e.g., pets, malaria relief) than unconventional ones (e.g., veg ads). Still, if you frame the cause in the right way, some people will support it. And <a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fCo3pLhkww">some people will do anything</a> if you're good at asking.  <img alt=":P" src="../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif"/> <br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>"This means that a donor will have to make regular $22 payments for ten months before any of their contribution can start to benefit children."<br/></div></blockquote><br/>That's an interesting way for the article to phrase it. If people don't like this state of affairs, then if they get solicited by someone asking for a donation, they should remember the name of the organization and donate later on their own. <span style="font-style: italic">However</span>, the notion that payments to fundraisers don't benefit children is actually untrue, because if paying fundraisers is a highly cost-effective way to get donations, then giving money to fundraisers is an excellent use of the charity's income.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>"Charities have defended the use of the middlemen to find donors, saying they raised up to £4 for every £1 of costs."<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Exactly. Counterintuitive but true.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>"It’s about raising awareness as well as money." - awesome! maybe this type of fundraising is more suited to organisations who also want to raise awareness?<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Yep. As long as the fundraiser doesn't make the organization sound greedy, it should be a net win publicity-wise.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>"The average ‘life’ of these recruited donors is five years."<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.probonoaustralia.com.au/news/2012/02/uk-street-fundraiser-closes-its-doors">http://www.probonoaustralia.com.au/news ... -its-doors</a><br/></div></blockquote><br/>Interesting to compare that with the figure from source #10 that 55% of donors drop out within 12 months. Does that mean that the other 45% stay on for an average of ~10 years? Or maybe the average is weighted by length of donation?<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>"For example, in 2005 new monthly donors brought in to Sick Kids earned the charity $4 million. But the cost of acquiring those doors was $3.5 million, leaving the charity just over $500,000 in actual contributions. What Sick Kids is banking on is that these donors will stay on, because the charity will keep all of the money they donate the next year."<br/></div></blockquote><br/>It sounds like this source is opposed to paid fundraising, but as Ruairi says, the Sick Kids argument seems sound without more context.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>yboris wrote:</cite>he said he was able to average over $3,000 per week (fundraising for ? UN Health organization). Most of the fundraising occurs on weekdays in the evening for about 4 hours, visiting perhaps 100 doors.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Wow!<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>yboris wrote:</cite>After hearing his lecture I am considering learning the skills to do this on the side of my full-time job or as a summer recreation (as a teacher I have summers off).</div></blockquote><br/>Go for it!

<div class="content"><div class="postrev hidden" data-snap="1">Hey:)<br/><br/>All this should be cautioned by the fact that I’ve seen other figures higher and lower! Should be taken with a whole handful of salt! Maybe I’ve made mistakes cause I’m using different sources from different countries, written at somewhat different times? Also most of the sources are people I’ve talked to or articles on the net.<br/><br/>There’s more information in the google doc but basically it seems there’s a lot of money to be made for charities from fundraising. "Face to face" fundraisers who try to get "sign ups" (to a direct debit monthly donation) on the street or door to door may average around 2 or 3 sign ups a day (1,2,3,4), each of these donors apparently donates around £8 per month (which maybe actually be over £9 with gift aid) (5,6) and apparently stay with their charity for 5 or 6 years on average. (7,8,9,10,11)<br/><br/>So the average total “lifetime value” of one days face to face fundraising seems to be around = 2 sign ups X £8/month X 60 months = £960<br/><br/>Apparently charities pay an average of £100 per sign up (12), which seemed very high at first considering fundraisers apparently get paid around £8-12 an hour (13).<br/><br/>But I spoke to a guy from the PFRA ( <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pfra.org.uk/">http://www.pfra.org.uk/</a> ) who said, anecdotally, that the cost isn’t much lower "in house", as you have to pay salaries, insurance (maybe there’s some way around this? signing a waiver?) and salaries of people overseeing the whole operation, etc.<br/><br/>Still, that means that although it will take a few years for the donors to "mature" a fundraiser is raising around £760 for their charity per working day, and that might be low.<br/><br/>What really puzzles me is the marginal benefit issue, I don’t see why it would be hard to recruit fundraisers, especially given the economic situation, a friend of mine went for an interview with "totalfundraising", she said it was a group interview and as far as I know she didn’t get the job so it doesn’t seem like they're short on people.<br/><br/>This also seems to suggest that marginal benefit may be an issue:<br/><br/>“Even in the current financial climate, the pattern of regular turnover of fundraising staff continues with fundraisers moving in order to meet their next challenge.  Although there are currently more jobs available, competition is still fierce and with pressure on recruiters to make the right appointment, candidates are being put under increasing scrutiny. That said, there are still shortages of job seekers in certain areas such as Direct Marketing and Major Donor fundraising.” (14)<br/><br/>But if one can make more money for a charity this way rather than as a pro. phil. it seems like a much better course of action, but then there’s the marginal benefit effect, and a charity can only employ a certain number of fundraisers so maybe it’s better to be a pro. phil. unless your marginal difference is better than your donations as a pro. phil.<br/><br/>However, if instead of looking for direct debits a charity is looking for cash or some other kind of immediate donation like cheques; then fundraising could be done, the fundraisers paid (and also insurance, admin costs, etc), and the result is immediate money for the charity. The charity doesn’t have to wait for the donors to “mature”.<br/><br/>Fundraising in this way it seems like a charity could have an infinite number of fundraisers (so no marginal benefit), as long as they are spread over a large enough geographical area. Or perhaps altruists could form branches of a charity in new areas and fundraise and/or hire fundraisers there. I think this seems like a fantastic idea. I wonder whether or not it would be possible for one person to run a very large fundraising operation in several countries or if more employees are needed, could these employees be "outside" hired individuals or would people with an interest and knowledge of the charity be needed (Is this a possible career for altruists? Seems like it could definitely rival pro. phil.)<br/><br/>It seems possible that even if the total amount gained per £ invested in “immediate” forms of fundraising is lower, the overall gain may be higher.

<div class="postrev" data-snap="4">Hey:)<br/>
<br/>
All this should be cautioned by the fact that I’ve seen other figures higher and lower! Should be taken with a whole handful of salt!

<br/>
So the average total “lifetime value” of one days face to face fundraising seems to be around = 2 sign ups X £8/month X 60 months = £960<br/>
<br/>
Apparently charities pay an average of £100 per sign up (12), which seemed very high at first considering fundraisers apparently get paid around £8-12 an hour (13).<br/>
<br/>
But I spoke to a guy from the PFRA ( <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pfra.org.uk/">http://www.pfra.org.uk/</a> ) who said, anecdotally, that the cost isn’t much lower "in house", as you have to pay salaries, insurance (maybe there’s some way around this? signing a waiver?) and salaries of people overseeing the whole operation, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Still, that means that although it will take a few years for the donors to "mature" a fundraiser is raising around £760 for their charity per working day, and that might be low.<br/>
<br/>
What really puzzles me is the marginal benefit issue, I don’t see why it would be hard to recruit fundraisers, especially given the economic situation, a friend of mine went for an interview with "totalfundraising", she said it was a group interview and as far as I know she didn’t get the job so it doesn’t seem like they're short on people.<br/>
<br/>
This also seems to suggest that marginal benefit may be an issue:<br/>
<br/>
“Even in the current financial climate, the pattern of regular turnover of fundraising staff continues with fundraisers moving in order to meet their next challenge.  Although there are currently more jobs available, competition is still fierce and with pressure on recruiters to make the right appointment, candidates are being put under increasing scrutiny. That said, there are still shortages of job seekers in certain areas such as Direct Marketing and Major Donor fundraising.” (14)<br/>
<br/>
But if one can make more money for a charity this way rather than as a pro. phil. it seems like a much better course of action, but then there’s the marginal benefit effect, and a charity can only employ a certain number of fundraisers so maybe it’s better to be a pro. phil. unless your marginal difference is better than your donations as a pro. phil.<br/>
<br/>
However, if instead of looking for direct debits a charity is looking for cash or some other kind of immediate donation like cheques; then fundraising could be done, the fundraisers paid (and also insurance, admin costs, etc), and the result is immediate money for the charity. The charity doesn’t have to wait for the donors to “mature”.<br/>
<br/>
Fundraising in this way it seems like a charity could have an infinite number of fundraisers (so no marginal benefit), as long as they are spread over a large enough geographical area. Or perhaps altruists could form branches of a charity in new areas and fundraise and/or hire fundraisers there. I think this seems like a fantastic idea.

"in the financial year of 2009-2010 street fundraising brought in 177,665 brand new donors to various charities, giving, roughly, on average £8 per month." <a class="postlink" href="http://blogs.redcross.org.uk/fundraising-and-events/2010/08/guest-post-in-defence-of-chuggers/">http://blogs.redcross.org.uk/fundraisin ... -chuggers/</a><br/>
<br/>
(6). The same person from (4) from the PFRA said roughly £8 and over £9 with gift aid, also this seems consistent with what other articles on the internet say. Maybe even low.<br/>
<br/>
(7). "On average, the supporter who signs up on the street will continue giving for 5 years" <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_fundraising">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_fundraising</a> (although without a citation!...)<br/>
<br/>
(8). "Once a donor signs up, the standing order lasts six years on average" - <a class="postlink" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2090680.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2090680.stm</a><br/>
<br/>
(9). "The average ‘life’ of these recruited donors is five years." - <a class="postlink" href="http://www.probonoaustralia.com.au/news/2012/02/uk-street-fundraiser-closes-its-doors">http://www.probonoaustralia.com.au/news ... -its-doors</a><br/>
<br/>
(10.) The guy who I talked to on the street who worked for "total fundraising" said donors stay for 5 years on average.<br/>
<br/>
(11). Funnily enough when I called total fundraising the person I spoke to said the average time a donor stays with a charity is 3 years!<br/>
<br/>
(12). "In 2010, an investigation by Newsnight found that charities were paying an average of £100" - <a class="postlink" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/mar/06/chugging-backlash-fundraising-charities">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree ... -charities</a> . This seems roughly in line with what the net says in other places, maybe a bit low, but maybe this can be brought down by fundraising in house.<br/>

So maybe the per-sign-up amount is a bonus on top of the hourly wage?<br/><br/>Of course, if you personally are the fundraiser, it's not a bad thing for you to be paid a lot, because you can just donate the excess.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><cite>Ruairi wrote:</cite>so maybe it’s better to be a pro. phil. unless your marginal difference is better than your donations as a pro. phil.<br/></div></blockquote><br/>Could be.

And in some countries donations by mobile phone are whats popular.
